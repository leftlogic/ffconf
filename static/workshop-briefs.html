  <p>As part of <a href="https://ffconf.org">ffconf</a>, I'm running two masterclass workshops as part of my conference in November
    that I wanted to let you know about.</p>
  <h4>Angular 5 with Gerard Sans</h4>
  <p>Angular 5 is right around the corner. If your team has ever used Angular, you'll know that you need to stay on top of all
    the updates to offer the most competitive products.</p>
  <p>Gerard Sans is a veteran Angular developer and trainer with years of experience, and he's done all the hard to work to
    understand what's coming next. His workshop includes: <em>what's new, advanced routing techniques, graphql, modern state management (using ngrx), next level RXJS motion principles and more.</em></p>

  <h4>Universal React using Next.js with me, Remy Sharp</h4>
  <p>The promise of Universal React? The same code running in the browser <em>and</em> the client? Next.js makes it easy to
    write JavaScript that you only have to write once, and it runs both in the browser and on the server. This offers huge
    benefits like SEO, improved performance to the visitor, and reduced code. </p>
  <p>Using Next.js, universal React requires very little overhead to create. The workshop includes: <em>instant server side rendered
    apps, connecting to databases, advanced routing, testing with jest (and gotchas) and deploying strategies.</em></p>

  <p>The workshops are full day masterclass run on 8th November 2017 in Brighton UK (about an hour from London by train).</p>

  <p>Limited tickets cost is £449+VAT (which also include a pass to the FFCONF event on 9th November worth £179 - making the
    workshop effectively £270!) - and if you want to send multiple developers, get in touch at <a href="mailto:events@leftlogic.com">events@leftlogic.com</a>    and we can arrange a block booking price. </p>
