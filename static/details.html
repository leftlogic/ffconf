  <p>The conference is being held at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, less than 15 minutes walk from
    Brighton train station. We recommend using <a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk">traintimes.org.uk</a> for up to
    date train timetables.</p>

  <p>If you are travelling home on Saturday 10th, please be aware that buses will replace train services between
    Brighton and Three Bridges. <a href="https://www.southernrailway.com/travel-information/plan-your-journey/planned-engineering-work?date=2018-11-10#engineering-departure-board">Check
      here for full details</a>.</p>

  <p>Hotel recommendations can be found on our website: <a href="https://ffconf.org/#locations">http://ffconf.org/#locations</a></p>

  <h2>Registration</h2>

  <p><strong>Doors open at 9am</strong> for registration and the conference starts at 9:40am sharp! There are no
    tickets for the conference, but you must bring a form of identification (bank card, driving licence etc) to pick up
    your delegate programme which also acts as your pass. Please keep your lanyard with you at all times as you will
    need it to get back into the venue. </p>

  <p><strong>The day will finish by 6pm</strong></p>

  <p>The schedule will be in your programme and online, and if your device supports Service Workers, the site will also
    work offline.</p>

  <p><strong>Note that by attending any of our events - workshops &amp; conference, you are agreeing to our code of
      conduct: <a href="https://ffconf.org/conduct">https://ffconf.org/conduct</a>.</strong></p>

  <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns or questions,
    please contact a member of staff (wearing ffconf t-shirts). Or contact Julie directly on (+44) 7546 025 070 by SMS
    or by calling.</p>

  <h2>Refreshments</h2>

  <p>Tea, Coffee and Danishes will be available from 9am in the upstairs bar and the ground floor. Further refreshments
    will be available from the same locations at the mid morning and mid afternoon breaks. We serve cow, soya and oat
    milk for the tea and coffee.</p>

  <p>Please note lunch is not included but we have a few recommendations here: <a href="https://ffconf.org/food">https://ffconf.org/food</a></p>

  <h2>Reduce, reuse, recycle</h2>

  <p>At registration, we will be collecting canvas bags for the local food bank so why not clear the clutter of old
    conference bags and donate to a good cause <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/thewhitehawk/">https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/thewhitehawk/</a></p>

  <p>The coffee cups we use are compostable but please do bring your own travel mug and water bottle too. </p>

  <h2>Tweets, blog posts, etc</h2>

  <p>Yes to all. Hashtag all the things with <span class="hashtag">#ffconf</span>.</p>

  <p>Feel free to follow the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/ffconf">@ffconf</a> for the latest info on
    the event.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to also <a href="https://ffconf.org/chat">join our Slack channel</a> for extra curricular
    chatter.</p>

  <h2>Technology</h2>

  <p>If you plan to bring a laptop, make sure it's fully charged for the day, as we only have a handful of charging
    stations in the venue.</p>

  <p>There is no wifi. I mean, it's a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good,
    so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.</p>

  <h2>Post conference social</h2>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> we use different locations for our socials - details below.</p>

  <p>Note that you're welcome to join both evenings regardless of when your ticket is for. However the drink vouchers
    are only available to those with the applicable day pass.</p>

  <p>The venues are open to all ages, but those of you under 18 years old, we ask that you don't try to buy any
    alcoholic drinks or ask anyone else to ask on your behalf. On Friday, you will also need to leave by 9pm as the
    venue doesn't have a license for under 18s beyond this time. All important, I'm sure you'll be super awesome and
    play nice.</p>

  <p>There will be food available to order and you collect your drinks voucher on the door.</p>

  <p>After party on both days starts at 6pm (after the conference closes) until late.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Thursday: Alcampo Lounge</strong> - 84-86 London Rd, Brighton BN1 4JF - a very short walk from the
      conference.</li>
    <li><strong>Friday: Oh So Social</strong> - 250a Kings Rd, Brighton BN1 1NB -on the beach, near the green doughnut</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Link for both venues and directions: <a href="https://ffconf.org/party">https://ffconf.org/party</a></p>

  <h2>Health and Safety</h2>

  <p>Please report any lost property to the registration desk. Left Logic and Duke of York's Picturehouse takes no
    responsibility for delegate's lost property so we ask you to be vigilant at all times.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>

  <p>Live Captioning will take place on Friday 9th November. The screen will be located on the stage on the left hand
    side. </p>

  <p>The ground floor is accessible to customers with limited mobility including wheelchair users. The Box Office,
    Kiosk, access toilet and screen are all located on the ground floor. There are four wheelchair spaces in the
    screen. From the foyer there is a small ramp from which to access the Kiosk and Screen.</p>

  <p>Large print schedules are available on request at the registration desk.</p>

  <p>We regret that there is no lift and consequently the Balcony and Bar can only be accessed by ascending a staircase
    of 25 steps.</p>

  <p>Left Logic would like to ensure that all delegates are able to have access therefore should you have any special
    requests please contact us in advance so we can accommodate your needs.</p>

  <p>There is a wheelchair-accessible adapted toilet on the ground floor.</p>
