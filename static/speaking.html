  <p>Hello all my dear speakers,</p>

  <p>Firstly​ ​- thank you so so much everyone for joining my merry band of speakers this year!</p>

  <p>This document includes lots of details, but for those of you that are as allergic to email as I am, here are the
    cliff notes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wednesday 6:45pm</strong>, meet us in the ​hotel foyer​ (Jurys Inn Brighton)​ to move on to speakers
      meal.</li>
    <li>You're repeating your talk, <strong>once on Thursday and once on Friday</strong> (at the same time).</li>
    <li>This document contains the schedule - at the very least, please make sure you know when you're on!</li>
    <li>Conference registration starts at <strong>9:00am</strong> with the first talk at 9:50am - please find me during
      the breaks if
      you're on in that next section so I can hook you up (with lapel mic &amp; laptop).</li>
    <li>Talks are <strong>40mins @ 1920x1080​</strong> from your own laptop​, and I'm not planning to take questions -
      also I will kick
      you off stage come time!</li>
    <li><strong>There is no internet</strong> or rather it's super, super flaky. I've got a mifi that you can use (let
      me know ahead of
      time), but err on the side of offline. Let me know ahead of time if you need internet.</li>
    <li>Thursday AND Friday evening - post event social until late (​or as late as you like)</li>
    <li><strong>Code of Conduct</strong> - if you're being harassed or notice someone else being harassed, please
      contact Julie or
      myself directly, and if you're unsure if your slides are okay, please get in touch.</li>
    <li>Those travelling overseas: <strong>you'll be provided with a SIM card preloaded with data</strong> to avoid a
      few data charges</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Any questions/issues/special requests please email (or call, our mobile numbers are at the bottom of this email).
    ​
    We have the Slacks - if you join the channel, we'll invite you to the &quot;green room&quot; where you can ping us
    too: <a href="https://ffconf.org/chat">https://ffconf.org/chat</a> (this is not required!)​</p>

  <p><strong>A short acknowledgement of this email will set my nerves at ease too ❤</strong></p>

  <p>The full detail follows.</p>

  <h1>Getting to Brighton</h1>

  <p>Julie has got in touch with you individually to help arrange getting you into our sunny city. Julie will also be
    in touch to follow up ​on transport from the airport for those flying in and equally please drop her a reply if you
    have any questions, it keeps us calm!</p>

  <h1>Accommodation</h1>

  <p>You're all staying in the Jury's Inn​ Brighton (which is right by the train station)​. For those of you ​coming by
    train, its a few minutes walk​: <a href="https://ffconf.org/station-to-hotel">https://ffconf.org/station-to-hotel</a>
    - exit the rear of Brighton Train Station (if
    you come through the gates, you'll turn immediately left and start heading for the car park as if you're walking
    back in the direction the train came from). Once at the rear, continue walking that direction for, say about 2
    minutes, depending on your leg length and you'll be at the hotel. Simple, but if you get stuck or lost, don't
    ​hesitate to get in touch (phone numbers at the end of this email).</p>

  <p>Check in for the hotel is 12pm and checkout is 12pm. There will be a welcome bag waiting for you at the hotel too.</p>

  <p>If you arrive earlier, and the hotel doesn't have the room ready, we've been told that the hotel will store your
    travel bags until then.</p>

  <h1>Wednesday evening</h1>

  <p>We're taking you out for some dinner. We've booked food for 7:00pm.</p>

  <p>We'll come and pick you up at the hotel foyer at 6:45pm where, depending on weather, we'll walk through town to
    the restaurant. If it's raining (something that's ever so uncommon in the UK…), we'll sort out a cab and head down
    together.</p>

  <p>If you have any specific dietary requirements (that you've not told us about already), please let us know ASAP so
    that we can make sure the restaurant accommodates you.</p>

  <h1>Thursday​ &amp; Friday​ ​dinner</h1>

  <p>​We'll have a tab for you at our post event at ​evening venues where you can order food (though the last
    orders for food are at 10pm Thursday, 9pm Friday). Of course, if you want to have a bit of down time before meeting people and grab food elsewhere, you're more than welcome to.​ We've got some food recommendations on the ffconf web site, and if there's anything specific, please do ask and we'll do our best to point you in a good direction.</p>

  <h1>Conference days</h1>

  <p>The conference registration opens at 9:00am. The schedule is in this email (and will appear fully on
    <a href="https://ffconf.org">https://ffconf.org</a> on Thursday).</p>

  <p>I'll introduce each of you, but please make sure you find me at the start of the break if you're on in the next
    segment so that I can make sure you're mic'ed up with your lapel mic.</p>

  <p>I'm assuming you have your own laptop, if not that's cool just make sure you've emailed me your presentation
    (either as a PDF or Keynote or something mac friendly) by the Tuesday before the event.</p>

  <p>Presentation are 40 minutes. Yes, FORTY minutes. I'm assuming we won't have time for questions, but doing 40
    minute talks without questions allows us for the first time to have 8 speakers without cutting breaks or finishing
    later (that said, <em>if</em> there's time for questions, there are roaming mics).</p>

  <p>Also, super important - exploit this fact: we're projecting on a cinema screen - your slides can and should be:
    1920x1080. Yep, it's a cinema, it's cool.</p>

  <p>If you want to do any extended technical set up, ideally arrive at 8:00am whilst we're doing the tech setup.
    Otherwise, it's a pretty straightforward to connect up your power, video and audio (if it applies) and we can do q
    test in the break before your talk.</p>

  <h1>The internet</h1>

  <p>...at the venu​e is non-existent​. I mean, it's a freaking cinema, why would it have internet?! But we do have
    work arounds. If you absolutely have to have the web, let me know ahead of time and we'll put you on one of my
    MIFIs. I use one to run the Confwall (don't worry - this is only​ on​ during the break) and I have a secondary one.</p>

  <h1>Thursday and Friday lunch (90mins)</h1>

  <p>We've pre-booked a table at a ​tasty pizza place for Thursday and a local​​ fish and chip restaurant for ​Friday.
    No visit to the bestest sea front city would be complete without a jolly good fish and chip meal!</p>

  <p>We've got the menu (there are veggie options too) which I'll share with you all on the day so that you have an
    idea of what you might like, so we can send someone ahead of time to place the order for us so there's not too much
    of a wait for food.</p>

  <h1>Post event social</h1>

  <p>After the conference (about 6pm) we'll ​go onto​ the social. Some of us will head back to the hotel to drop stuff
    off, others will go directly to the after party. It'll end around midnight (or earlier depending on demand).</p>

  <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

  <p>We use the <a href="https://2018.ffconf.org/code-of-conduct">https://2018.ffconf.org/code-of-conduct</a> as our
    code of conduct, and we ask that you familiarise
    yourself with it and if you're unsure if your slides or content could be a problem, please get in touch with me any
    time to talk about them. I'll help as much as I can.</p>

  <p>We've included this on everyone's lanyard, and equally goes for all of you: If you are being harassed, notice that
    someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
    immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing ffconf t-shirts. You can also phone or
    text us (numbers at the end of this email) or send a DM to @ffconf.</p>

  <p>If there's anything you're unsure about in your slides, please feel free to reach out to me to check. Equally, if
    you want any extra eyes on your slides, please feel free to ask.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Once again, any questions, feel free to get in touch with me or Julie - we're watching our email fairly closely in
    the run up to the conference, so you should get a prompt-ish reply. Again, Julie will be following up regarding
    travel arrangements if they haven't already been sorted.</p>

  <p>If you want to call my mobile number is: +44 (0)7590 497258 and Julie is on +44 (0)7888 763822.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, we'll see you on Wednesday evening at your hotel if not before 💖❤💓</p>
