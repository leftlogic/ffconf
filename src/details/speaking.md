<mark>This URL is available offline thanks to a service worker</mark>

Firstly - thank you so-so much everyone for joining my merry band of speakers this year!

I'll say this first: **a short acknowledgement that you've read the headlines will set my nerves at ease ❤️**


This document includes lots of details, but for those of you that are as allergic to long form as I am, here are the cliff notes:

- **Thursday 7:00pm**, meet us in your hotel foyer (Leonardo Hotels - formerly Jury's Inn, Brighton) to move on to the speaker's meal.
- This document contains the schedule at the very least, please make sure you know when you're on!
- Conference registration starts at **9:00am** with the first talk at 9:50am - please find me (usually near the stage) during the breaks if you're on in that next section so I can hook you up (with lapel mic battery pack needs to attach to your clothing, please bear this in mind). The podium will have both speakers' machines for that upcoming session.
- Talks are **30-35mins @ 1920x1080** from your laptop, we don't do Q/A.
- **There is no internet** or rather it's flaky. I've got a mifi that you can use (let me know ahead of time), but err on the side of offline, give me heads up if you need it.
- If you can, please send me your slides the day before, I can pass this onto our stenographer to help with the live captions.
- Friday evening - post event social until late (or as late as you like) - **dinner and drinks are on us**.
- **Code of Conduct** - if you see or hear the code being breached, please contact Julie or myself directly, and if you're unsure of anything in your slides, please get in touch.
- If you're feeling ill (or COVID rears it's head) please let me know, I have contingencies in place.

Any questions/issues/special requests please email (or call, our mobile numbers are at the bottom of this email). We have the (a rather quiet) Discord channel - if you join the channel, we'll invite you to the "green room" where you can ping us too: https://ffconf.org/chat (this is not required!)

We also have a [group whatsapp chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IMW8dgoiLdBGmRb5Udw8xt) if you want to join (this is only myself, Julie and open to you) and either ask questions or post pictures of cats (this is actually quite useful for the day to shoot quick questions like *"I need coffee - halp!"*)

**A short acknowledgement of this email will set my nerves at ease too ❤️**

The full detail follows.

## Getting to Brighton

Julie has got in touch with you individually to help arrange getting you into our sunny/rainy/blustery/the-weather-is-all-over-the place city but please drop her a reply if you have any questions, it keeps us calm!

## Accommodation

You're all staying in the Leonardo Hotels Brighton (which is right by the train station). For those of you coming by train, it's a few minutes walk: https://ffconf.org/station-to-hotel - exit the rear of Brighton Train Station (if you come through the gates, you'll turn immediately left and start heading for the car park as if you're walking back in the direction the train came from). Once at the rear, continue walking that direction for, say about 2 minutes, depending on your leg length and you'll be at the hotel. Simple, but if you get stuck or lost, don't hesitate to get in touch (phone numbers at the end of this email).

Check in for the hotel is 3pm and checkout is 11am.

If you arrive earlier, and the hotel doesn't have the room ready, we've been told that the hotel will store your travel bags until then.

## Thursday evening

We're taking you out for some dinner at [Bills Brighton](https://bills-website.co.uk/restaurants/brighton/).

We'll come and pick you up at the hotel foyer at 7pm where, depending on weather, we'll walk through town to the restaurant. If it's driving raining (something that's ever so uncommon in the UK…), we'll sort out a cab and head down together.

If you have any specific dietary requirements (that you've not told us about already), please let us know as soon as possible so that we can make sure the restaurant accommodates you.

## Conference day

The conference registration opens at 9:00am. The schedule is in this email and is at https://2024.ffconf.org.

I'll introduce each of you, please make sure **you find me at the start of the break if you're on in the next** segment so that I can make sure you're mic'ed up with your lapel mic.

**Presentations are 30-35 minutes.** The podium will have the next two speaker's laptops ready and connected.

I'm assuming you have your own laptop, if not that's cool just make sure you've emailed me your presentation (either as a PDF or Keynote or something mac friendly) by the Tuesday before the event.

We're projecting on a cinema screen - your slides can and should be: 1920x1080. Yep, it's a cinema, it's neat.

If you want to do any extended technical set up, ideally arrive at 8:00am whilst we're doing the tech setup. Otherwise, it's pretty straightforward to connect up your power, video and audio (if it applies) and we can do a test in the break before your talk.

## The internet

...at the venue is (near) non-existent. I mean, it's a freaking cinema, why would it have internet?! But we do have work arounds. If you absolutely have to have the web, let me know ahead of time and we'll put you on one of my MIFIs.

## Friday lunch (90mins)

We've pre-booked a table at a local fish and chip restaurant for Friday. No visit to the bestest seafront city would be complete without a jolly good Brighton meal!

We've got the menu with veggie options which I'll share with you all on the day so that you have an idea of what you might like, so we can send someone ahead of time to place an order for us so there's not too much of a wait for food.

## Post event social / Friday dinner

The private venue we've hired for our social serves food until 9pm. All food and drink, of course, will be on us.

Some of us will head back to the hotel to drop stuff off, others will go directly to the after party. It'll end around midnight (or earlier depending on demand … or [evacuations](https://tweets.remysharp.com/1189506219368685569/) as we did in 2018!).

## Accessibility and COVID

Live Captioning will be provided remotely by White Coat Captioning. We're working on providing captions directly on the cinema screen in a margin below your slides. Failing that a screen will be located on the stage on the left hand side (facing the stage).

The ground floor is accessible to customers with limited mobility including wheelchair users.

The Box Office, Kiosk, access toilet and screen are all located on the ground floor. From the foyer there is a small ramp from which to access the Kiosk and Screen.

Large print schedules are available on request at the registration desk.

We regret that there is no lift and consequently the Balcony and Bar can only be accessed by ascending a staircase of 25 steps.

Gender neutral and accessible toilets are available on the ground floor near to the exits.

COVID safety. We ask anyone who is showing signs of COVID to please stay at home. We welcome the use of masks indoors.

Please also take a moment to review our [COVID policy](https://ffconf.org/covid/)

Remy and Julie want to ensure that everyone is able to have access therefore should you have any special requests please contact us in advance so we can accommodate your needs.

## Code of Conduct

We use the https://ffconf.org/code-of-conduct/ as our code of conduct, and we ask that you familiarise yourself with it and if you're unsure if your slides or content could be a problem, please get in touch with me any time to talk about them. I'll help as much as I can.

We've included this on everyone's lanyard, and equally goes for all of you: If you see or hear the code of conduct being breached, please speak to me (Remy), Julie or one of our volunteers wearing FFConf t-shirts. You can also phone or text us (numbers at the end of this email) or send a DM to [@FFConf](https://twitter.com/ffconf).

If there's anything you're unsure about in your slides, please feel free to reach out to me to check. Equally, if you want any extra eyes on your slides, please feel free to ask.

*If you've read this far, I'll be amazed. But also, you're amazing for reading this far (or at least skimming to this bit).*

________________________________

Once again, any questions, feel free to get in touch with me or Julie - we're watching our email fairly closely in the run up to the conference, so you should get a prompt-ish reply.

If you want to call my (Remy) mobile number is: +44 (0)7590 497258 and Julie is on +44 (0)7888 763822 - and we have a [WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IMW8dgoiLdBGmRb5Udw8xt) (just myself, Julie and yourselves) that you can join if you like.

Otherwise, we'll see you on Thursday evening at your hotel if not before ❤️❤️❤️

Remy & Julie
