Post event, if you blog about your experiences (and hashtag #ffconf), then we will choose two people at random to win tickets to ffconf 2020!

## Technology

If you plan to bring a laptop/device, make sure it's fully charged for the day, as we only have a handful of charging stations in the venue.

There is no wifi. I mean, it's a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.

## Post conference social

We hope you will join us at OhSo Social again (and fingers crossed there won't be a storm again this year!) There will be food available to order until 9PM and you collect your drinks voucher on the door so please bring your name badge/lanyard with you. We will also have a range of board games so try an old favourite or learn a new game and make new friends.

Oh So Social - 250a Kings Rd, Brighton BN1 1NB - on the beach, near the green doughnut

## Pre conference

### Async - 7-Nov

The night before ffconf, on 7th November, there will be a [special Show'n'Tell edition of Async](https://www.meetup.com/Async-Web-Tech-Meetup/events/265460562/), our local JavaScript meetup in Brighton. The event will be held at [The Skiff](https://goo.gl/maps/HVDuK8EeSo6cS3mRA); doors open at 7.15pm.

Everybody is welcome and no need to sign up in advance, just come along. Furthermore, if you have some little project you've been working on or some new technology you're excited about, you can grab yourself a 5 minute speaker's slot by [adding a comment to this gist](https://gist.github.com/orangespaceman/196f4e37b2dcd5bee37fe1367bbf2896).

### Pre conference social - 7-Nov

Join us at [Al Campo Lounge](https://thelounges.co.uk/alcampo/)Â from 6:30pm on Thursday 7-Nov, to meet your fellow delegates, just an 8 minute walk from the station. We have the raised area on the left hand side reserved so anyone sat in that area is your new ff friend.

### Pre event networking: running or coffee - 8 Nov

For the first time, we are hosting a pre-ffconf run! Meet outside Duke of Yorks at 7:45AM led by two ffconf regulars, Chetan and Matt. Open to all abilities, a short 30 minute run leaving plenty of time to get showered before registration opens!

Not a runner? Moes@thecircus is practically next to Duke of York's and open from 7am and is a great place to grab a coffee and meet fellow attendees: [https://ffconf.org/morning-network](https://ffconf.org/morning-network)
