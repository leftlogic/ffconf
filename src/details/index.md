## Directions

How to get to our venue from the station: [ffconf.org/directions](https://ffconf.org/directions)

The conference is being held at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, less than 15 minutes walk from Brighton train station. We recommend using [traintimes.org.uk](https://traintimes.org.uk) for up to date train timetables.

At the moment there are no planned engineering works on the trains, and you can check [up to date changes here](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/status-and-disruptions/).

<!-- [Hotel recommendations](https://2024.ffconf.org/#locations) can also be found on our website. -->

## Registration - 9am

Doors open at 9am for registration and the conference starts at 9:40am sharp! There are no tickets for the conference, but please bring a form of identification (bank card, driving licence etc) to pick up your delegate programme which also acts as your pass. Please keep your lanyard with you at all times as you will need it to get back into the venue.

The day will finish by 6pm. The schedule will be in your programme and online, and if your device supports Service Workers, the site will also work offline.

Note that by attending our events, you are agreeing to our [code of conduct](https://ffconf.org/code-of-conduct/).

If see or hear our code of conduct being breached, or have any other concerns or questions, please contact a member of staff (wearing FFConf t-shirts), our BlueSky [@ffconf](https://bsky.app/profile/ffconf.org) DMs are open.

## Refreshments and lunch

Tea, coffee, danishes and fruit will be available from 9am in the upstairs bar and the ground floor. Further refreshments will be available from the same locations at the mid morning and mid afternoon breaks. We serve cow, soya and oat milk for the tea and coffee plus vegan and gluten free snack options. If you have a nut allergy, please let us know.

**Please note lunch is not included** but we have [a few recommendations here](https://ffconf.org/food), and a [collection of places](https://ffconf.org/brighton) that Remy & Julie particularly like (with lunch, coffee, sweet and dinner suggestions).

## Lunch with future friends

If you are coming to FFConf for the first time, travelling alone or just want to meet new people, we have tables reserved at [Alcampo Lounge](https://goo.gl/maps/LjgEszGnouR53Hqq5) or Mexican food at [New Unity](https://www.newunity.pub/) for our Lunch with Future Friends.

## Reduce, reuse, recycle

The coffee cups we use are compostable but please do bring your own travel mug and water bottle too. Feel free to leave your lanyard at the end so they can be reused.

## Toots, chat and blog posts

Yes to all. Hashtag all the things with [#FFConf](https://bsky.app/search?q=%23ffconf).

Feel free to follow us [on BlueSky at @FFConf](https://bsky.app/profile/ffconf.org) for the latest info on the event.

<!-- The event will have live commentary uploaded on our Mastodon account. -->

Please feel free to also [join our Discord](https://ffconf.org/chat) for extra curricular chatter (it's quiet and friendly, so bring your voice&nbsp;❤️).

Post-event, please blog about your experiences or post on LinkedIn using #FFConf

## Technology

If you plan to bring a laptop/device, make sure it's fully charged for the day, as we only have a handful of charging stations in the venue.

Do not rely on the wifi. I mean, it's a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.

Err on the side of low tech and an open mind and you'll get the most from the event!

## Post conference social

We hope you will join us at OhSo Social again. There will be food available to order until 9pm and you can collect your drinks voucher on the door so please bring your name badge/lanyard with you. We will also have a range of board games so try an old favourite or learn a new game and make new friends.

Oh So Social - [250a Kings Rd, Brighton BN1 1NB](https://goo.gl/maps/ZHdtZQLsg5LuDfQK8) - on the beach, near the green doughnut on the west of the Brighton Palace Pier (to the right of the pier if you're facing the sea).

## Pre conference

### Show and Tell with Async - 13 Nov

Our friends at Async run a very special International Show & Tell from 7pm at Projects, Nile House (please note new location). Come along to listen, learn and meet fellow delegates or you could give a five minute talk to tell us about something… a project, a library, a technique, a story, or anything else about JavaScript, related tech (HTML, CSS, SVG, etc), or the wider world of web. 

(https://asyncjs.com/international-show-n-tell-2025/)

After Async, we will be heading to The Walrus on Ship Street. We will NOT be in Al Campo on Thursday evening.

### Pre event networking: running or coffee - 14 Nov

We are hosting another pre-FFConf run! Meet outside Duke of Yorks at 7:30am led by two friendly FFConf regulars. Open to all abilities, explore beautiful Brighton in a short 30 minute run leaving plenty of time to get showered before registration opens!

For those who prefer a slower start to the day, our friends at Brighton Codebar host a coffee morning from 8AM to welcome delegates for early refreshments at Curio Cafe is practically next to Duke of York's [ffconf.org/morning-network](https://ffconf.org/morning-network).

## Health and Safety

Please report any lost property to the registration desk. Left Logic and Duke of York's Picturehouse takes no responsibility for delegate's lost property so we ask you to be vigilant at all times.

Please note that there is no cloakroom or storage for any items.

## Accessibility

Live Captioning will be provided by White Coat Captioning. The screen will be located on the stage on the left hand side.

The ground floor is accessible to customers with limited mobility including wheelchair users.

The Box Office, Kiosk, access toilet and screen are all located on the ground floor. From the foyer there is a small ramp from which to access the Kiosk and Screen.

Large print schedules are available on request at the registration desk.

If you do not wish to be included in any official photos, you can get a different coloured lanyard from the photographer or from registration.

We regret that there is no lift and consequently the Balcony and Bar can only be accessed by ascending a staircase of 25 steps.

People should be able to use toilet appropriate to how they self identify.

Please use the toilet you feel most comfortable using, and please respect people's right to pee in peace.

Gender neutral and accessible toilet is available on the ground floor near to the exits. 

COVID safety. We ask anyone who is showing signs of COVID to please stay at home. We welcome the use of masks indoors.

Please also take a moment to review our [COVID policy](https://ffconf.org/covid/)

Remy and Julie want to ensure that everyone is able to have access therefore should you have any special requests please contact us in advance so we can accommodate your needs.
