## Technology

If you plan to bring a laptop/device, make sure it's fully charged for the day, as we only have a handful of charging stations in the venue.

There is no wifi. I mean, it's a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.

## Post conference social

We hope you will join us at OhSo Social again (and fingers crossed there wonâ€™t be a storm again this year!) There will be food available to order until 9PM and you collect your drinks voucher on the door. We will also have a range of board games so try an old favourite or learn a new game and make new friends.
