## Directions

How to get to our venue from the station: [ffconf.org/directions](https://ffconf.org/directions)

The conference is being held at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, less than 15 minutes walk from Brighton train station. We recommend using [traintimes.org.uk](https://traintimes.org.uk) for up to date train timetables.

Unfortunately, there are planned engineering works on Saturday 12th November and there will be a rail replacement bus between Brighton and Three Bridges.

[Hotel recommendations](https://2022.ffconf.org/#locations) can also be found on our website.

## Registration - 9am 11-Nov

Doors open at 9am for registration and the conference starts at 9:40am sharp! There are no tickets for the conference, but you must bring a form of identification (bank card, driving licence etc) to pick up your delegate programme which also acts as your pass. Please keep your lanyard with you at all times as you will need it to get back into the venue.

The day will finish by 6pm. The schedule will be in your programme and online, and if your device supports Service Workers, the site will also work offline.

Note that by attending our events, you are agreeing to our [code of conduct](https://ffconf.org/code-of-conduct/).

If see or hear our code of conduct being breached, or have any other concerns or questions, please contact a member of staff (wearing ffconf t-shirts), our [@ffconf](https://twitter.com/ffconf) DMs are open.

## Refreshments and lunch

Tea, coffee, danishes and fruit will be available from 9am in the upstairs bar and the ground floor. Further refreshments will be available from the same locations at the mid morning and mid afternoon breaks. We serve cow, soya and oat milk for the tea and coffee plus vegan and gluten free snack options.

**Please note lunch is not included** but we have [a few recommendations here](https://ffconf.org/food), and a [collection of places](https://ffconf.org/brighton) that Remy & Julie particularly like (with lunch, coffee, sweet and dinner suggestions).

If you are coming to ffconf for the first time, travelling alone or just want to meet new people, we have tables reserved at Alcampo Lounge or vegan food at Worlds End.

## Reduce, reuse, recycle

The coffee cups we use are compostable but please do bring your own travel mug and water bottle too.

## Tweets, blog posts, etc

Yes to all. Hashtag all the things with [#ffconf](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ffconf&src=typed_query&f=live).

Feel free to follow the Twitter account [@ffconf](https://twitter.com/ffconf) for the latest info on the event.

Please feel free to also [join our Discord](https://ffconf.org/chat) for extra curricular chatter (it's still new and quiet, so bring your voice ❤️).

Post event, if you blog about your experiences (and post us a tweet with the hashtag #ffconf), then we will choose two people at random **to win tickets to ffconf 2023**!

## Technology

If you plan to bring a laptop/device, make sure it's fully charged for the day, as we only have a handful of charging stations in the venue.

There is no wifi. I mean, it's a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.

Err on the side of bringing a notepad and an open mind and you'll get the most from the event!

## Post conference social

We hope you will join us at OhSo Social again. There will be food available to order until 9PM and you can collect your drinks voucher on the door so please bring your name badge/lanyard with you. We will also have a range of board games so try an old favourite or learn a new game and make new friends.

## Pre conference

### Show and Tell with Async - 10-Nov

Our friends at Async are running a very special International Show & Tell at 7:15PM at Spaces. If you're interested in giving a five minute talk, they'd also love to hear from you. [Please sign up in advance](https://asyncjs.com/events/) (to attend or speak). To find out more, see their Twitter [@asyncjs](https://twitter.com/asyncjs)

### Pre conference social - 10-Nov

Join us at [Al Campo Lounge](https://thelounges.co.uk/alcampo/) from 7pm on Thursday 10-Nov, to meet your fellow delegates, just an 8 minute walk from the station. We have the raised area on the left hand side reserved so anyone sat in that area is your new ff friend.

### Pre event networking: running or coffee - 11 Nov

We are hosting another pre-ffconf run! Meet outside Duke of Yorks at 7:30am led by two friendly ffconf regulars, Chetan and Matt. Open to all abilities, a short 30 minute run leaving plenty of time to get showered before registration opens!

Not a runner? Moes@thecircus is practically next to Duke of York's and open from 8am and is a great place to grab a coffee and meet fellow attendees: [ffconf.org/morning-network](https://ffconf.org/morning-network).

Kindly hosted by Anwen Williams, one of the Brighton Codebar organisers.

## Health and Safety

Please report any lost property to the registration desk. Left Logic and Duke of York's Picturehouse takes no responsibility for delegate's lost property so we ask you to be vigilant at all times.

Live Captioning will be provided by White Coat Captioning. The screen will be located on the stage on the left hand side.

The ground floor is accessible to customers with limited mobility including wheelchair users.

The Box Office, Kiosk, access toilet and screen are all located on the ground floor. From the foyer there is a small ramp from which to access the Kiosk and Screen. There is a wheelchair-accessible adapted toilet on the ground floor.
