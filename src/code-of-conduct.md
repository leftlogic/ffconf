# Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Introduction

We want {% ffconf %} to be the Future Friends Conference. Please treat each other with respect. Make new friends. Learn new things. Be kind to each other.

If you are being harassed, notice anyone else being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us.

## Need Help?

You can email [Remy](mailto:remy@leftlogic.com) or [Julie](mailto:julie@leftlogic.com) or [both](mailto:events@leftlogic.com) ahead of the event. We also have open DMs on our [@{% ffconf %}](https://twitter.com/ffconf) twitter account.

For the day event, you will also have access to a mobile number that you can send SMS messages if you need to notify us of any issues, along with our staff being in {% ffconf %} branded t-shirts. (Please note: this page will be updated closer to the time with additional details).

## Our code of conduct

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
