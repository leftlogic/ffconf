# Our COVID policy

This is a placeholder and work in progress document as we're currently working on the contents of this policy for our upcoming ffconf 2022.

In short, masks are encouraged and welcomed, we politely request that all attendees do a lateral flow test within 24 hours of the conference and of course if you are showing signs of Covid or illness, please stay home.

Some of the items we intend to add:

- Notes about ventilation in the venue
- Masks being provided
- Stickers used for social distancing
