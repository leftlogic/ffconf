# Our COVID policy

This is a placeholder document as we're currently working on the contents of this policy for our upcoming ffconf 2022.

It will be in place before the event so that people can find out what the venue is like and what we have to support those who want to shield.

**This document is a work in progress as of 20 October 2022**
