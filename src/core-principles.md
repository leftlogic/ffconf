# Core Principles

Since it's inception in 2009, FFConf has been evolving, and with that the core principles have shifted over time.

**People over Technology**: The conference's central belief is that technology is only interesting because of the people behind it. The focus is on human stories, personal experiences, and building community, not on technical "how-to"s or "a single line of code."

**Inspiration and Motivation**: The goal is to "inspire, inform and educate." The event is curated to make attendees return to work excited and motivated to create positive change, rather than just teaching them a new framework or feature.

**Championing a Better Web**: The conference is driven by a deep care for making the web a more open, diverse, equal, and ethical platform. It actively seeks out challenging conversations about privacy, bias, accessibility, and inclusion.
