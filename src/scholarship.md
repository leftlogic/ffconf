# Inclusion Scholarship

This post outlines our inclusion scholarships programme. It's entirely possible that this does not apply to you, my dear reader, but you still have an important role to play: please pass on the message and this link to help seek those out who can make use of the scholarships.

## What are the scholarships?

Scholarships are available for anyone in an under-represented group in tech. This includes (but is not limited to): people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, people who identify as women and people with disabilities.

We have a limited number of scholarships available which includes a ticket to the day FFConf event, travel to Brighton (from your city) and hotel as required.

Please note that we prioritise people who have not received a scholarship from us in previous years.

To maximise our limited budget, we can only offer travel expense applications to those based the UK and Europe.

## How to apply

We ask a few questions, but don't have to explain your personal situation to us (but you can of course, if you want to). We trust you in this point :)

1. Who are you?
2. Why should you get a scholarship?
3. Where would you be travelling from (airport and city)?

Please note that your application will be treated with the utmost privacy and we will not publicly announce who the inclusion scholarships go to (though you're welcome to say so yourself).

**Deadline for applications: 13th October.**

## How to Help

You can start with spreading the word, sharing this post both on social media, but also any communities you might know that would benefit from.

We will also be selling a scholarship ticket on our ticket page which you can opt-in whether you want to be credited. In addition, we will allow you to donate an arbitrary amount towards the scholarship fund (which helps with travel and hotels).

## Acknowledgements & background

We created this scholarship in 2015, and you can read about the why in the <a href="https://remysharp.com/2015/08/28/diversity-scholarships#why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original post</a>.

Again, if this doesn't apply to you, please please can you pass on the message and reach out to anyone you know that might benefit from one of these scholarship places.
