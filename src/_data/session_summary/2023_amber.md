This talk explores imposter syndrome and overworking in tech through Amber's transition from a non-technical background to software engineering. She outlines six common forms of imposter syndrome, linking them to perfectionism and burnout, while highlighting how systemic issues–like race and gender–amplify these challenges. Rather than blaming individuals, she critiques workplace culture and offers practical strategies like tracking wins and fostering psychological safety, encouraging a shift to a “learn-it-all” mindset for more sustainable, compassionate work.
