        "description": "JavaScript had a bumpy ride up to now, from its origins as a CGI-replacement, initiator of countless popups and annoying effects over the renaissance as Ajax enabler up to becoming wrapped up in libraries to work around the hell that is browser differences.\n\n\n\nWith the ubiquity of JavaScript comes a new challenge. How do we keep JavaScript safe when browsers don't really distinguish between different sources and give them all the same rights? Why do we still judge the usefulness of JavaScript by how badly browsers speak it?\n\n\n\nLearn about some environments you can use JavaScript in securely and marvel at the magic and annoyances that are technologies that try to put a lock on the issue of JavaScript security.",

Add these two technologies to your toolbox to begin building next-gen mobile apps today.\n\n\n\nWith more than 4.6 billion handsets on the planet, we know the future of the web is mobile, but what's the future of mobile? The latest builds of mobile browsers include HTML5 APIs, which enable speedy hardware-accelerated CSS, offline capability, client-side storage, geolocation and other goodies. But, what's next?\n\n\n\nTwo web technologies are ushering in the next generation of mobile apps: widgets and device APIs. As self-contained web apps, widgets significantly improve user experience. Device APIs do more than extend web apps to mobile devices. They allow access to native device sensors, like the accelerometer and camera, and to data such as photos and contacts. By adding widgets and device APIs to your toolbox, you can start building sophisticated mobile apps now.\n\n\n\nIn this session, PhoneGap hacker Brian LeRoux will guide you through the step-by-step creation of a W3C widget. He'll show you how to combine it with device APIs and deploy it using the PhoneGap open source framework. Learn how to develop for the mobile web of the future, today.",

Organising the engineers around a common goal is one thing, but organising your code so that people can work efficiently is another. Many large applications suffer from growing pains after just a few months in production due to poorly designed JavaScript with unclear upgrade and extension paths. Learn the tips, tricks, and techniques that allowed large sites such as My Yahoo! and the Yahoo! homepage to continue to grow, scale, and change over time without throwing away previous work. This talk isn't specific to any JavaScript library, rather, it gives you new ways to apply the libraries you're already using. The principles of good, loosely-coupled design apply to any system, and you'll learn how this can help your application today.",

To really exploit this power, we have to step outside the comfort zone of text-oriented publishing and engage with the full field of computer engineering.\n\n\n\nMaths are an essential part of this. While for most people, maths inspires dread, it's the most powerful tool we have, and the most flexible lego set you can get your hands on. In this talk I want to show you some clever mathematical machines, and what the pieces inside are doing. In a browser, naturally. And while true mathematicians will frown at the clear disregard for rigorous derivation, I think my way is more fun.\n\n\n\n",

But making use of client side storage is not just necessary to make an app that works offline - it can also hugely improve the user experience of your site when the user does have connectivity as well.
