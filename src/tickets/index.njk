      <blockquote>
        <p>Heading home after a wonderful #ffconf. It was great to meet so many web friends in real life, and see some
          inspiring talks. Buzzing with ideas now!</p>- <a

      <blockquote>
        <p>Attending the ffconf was such an inspiring experience for me. Back then I had zero knowledge on coding apart
          from interest in programming in general, and now I'm studying at a full time bootcamp working on making a web
          app purely in Javascript.</p>-<strong> S√©jin via email</strong>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The conference was amazing and one of the best events I have attended in regards to interesting and inspiring
          content. People also seemed to be very friendly towards each other and I loved seeing so many women attending
          as
          well!</p> - <strong>Natalia via email</strong>

      <blockquote>
        <p>It's a wonderful conference with a clear emphasis on community, diversity and inclusivity. The result is an
          eclectic line up and an array of talks that validate, inspire and energise.</p>
        <p>

          If you've never been, I can't recommend it enough</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>As a web developer I couldn't have asked for anything more. #ffconf you not just talk about diversity and
          inclusivity you also put them in action. Every topic and speaker were unique and diverse. Thanks for making me
          a
          better developer. Hopefully I will make it to next one.</p> - <a

      <blockquote>
        <p>Years ago, Paul Cuthbertson introduced me to a life-changing conference. Not only did I find my current job
          through chatting with people there, but the talks I saw and the people I met throughout the years were the
          inspiration and acceptance I desperately needed to find.</p>- <a

      <blockquote>
        <p>I feel like the day had a great balance of talks, covering many aspects that are important as a software
          developer and not just the traditional 'technical content' avenue. I believe that this emphasis on skills and
          ideas that are not just technical knowledge but also how to be a developer in the context of a team and
          community is a great asset and one I'd like to see more of. Indeed, this year was my first ffconf, but
          hopefully not my last!</p> - <a href="https://www.sitepen.com/blog/reflecting-on-ffconf-2018">James via
