# Why attend as a team?

At its core, FFConf is about community and connection. The talks from the day facilitate these important aspects and move us towards being better in our workplace and on the web.

It's not uncommon for a business to send a single individual to an event to then report back to the business what they learnt - partly to share the newly acquired knowledge.

The thing is, anyone can watch a video online, short or long form and share those learnings. Why even attend an event when you can get ChatGPT or Gemini to crunch through all the videos and summarise the content for you?

Events like FFConf can't be summarised with a few cliff notes or generative AI. Making the physical space in your day to sit with your thoughts during the event is invaluable. The shared energy and conversations with like-minded people make being there in person essential.

Local Brighton-based Bamboo Nine, [wrote](https://www.bamboonine.co.uk/blog/ffconf-2023/) of FFConf 2023:

> Returning from the conference, our team felt enriched with new knowledge and ideas, ready to apply these insights into our projects.
>
> The conference provided a deep understanding of various tech topics and a chance to connect with industry peers, fostering a sense of community and teamwork.

Each year FFConf has a broad range of talks for people who work with the web. From ethics and privacy, to how junior developers think and how we can support them, to the biases we unconditionally add to work and how we can challenge these, to how side and indie projects can inspire us to be better developers, designers and managers.

**Limited [**tickets**](/tickets) are still available and the event is held in Brighton on Friday 14th November.**

Send your team. Your business will benefit from a renewed fire in their work. Happy team: happy business.
