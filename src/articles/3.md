title: "How ffconf is curated üî¨"

As I write, the 2018 web site is being built by [Giulia Alfonsi](https://twitter.com/electric_g) [](https://twitter.com/electric_g)(who's been turning around the code for the last 4 years).

When the site goes live (**in about 2 weeks**), you should expect to see some key information:

1.  When the tickets will be available (and yes, I'll be emailing and tweeting that vital information!)
2.  The list of sessions we already have lined up
3.  Our current stock of sponsors - without whom we wouldn't be able to pull off our 10th event (and **[please do get in touch](mailto:mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=sponsorship)** if your company would like to be part of this year)

Speaking of sessions, one of the most important jobs I have is to curate **ffconf** each year. This involves thinking about topics I already want to learn more about and looking at subjects that are being discussed amongst the web community that appear to be important (and no, an entire 40 minute talk on tabs vs. spaces isn't technically _that_ important!).

Once the very first **ffconf** was over, people immediately asked me (literally at the after party) when the next event would be. From that moment, I knew that if we were to run it again, the event would always need to be content driven. That's to say: no "super hero" speakers (which I think we were seeing a lot of in the early 2010s), and a rule that I imposed: **no speaker returns**.

This makes finding speakers that match the content I want to hear about increasingly hard each year, but I also feel that it's an organiser's responsibility to present new faces. It also means that after **ffconf** v10, we would have **presented 84 speakers** (the first 2 years we had 7 speakers and we ran a secondary event in 2013). Julie and I are immensely proud of that fact alone.

I'm often asked "what's the theme for this year" or even post-event I've had people tell me what they thought the theme was. The truth is the common thread amongst the talks is usually a happy accident. One theme I personally do see each year, albeit a lofty theme, is: **how do we do better job tomorrow?**

At time of writing this post, I have already locked in 6 sessions with 6 amazing individuals in their own right - but of course you can expect to see 8 sessions on the day itself.

A sneak preview of some of these subjects include:

*   WebXR (that's Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality)
*   Web Animation (using native APIs)
*   Machine Learning using TensorFlow
*   Mentoring others
*   Beyond the edge of browsers - _The intersection of health and animation with biofeedback sensors, the future of 3d in the browser complete with interviews with people who are writing these specs_

I'll post some relevant links in **[our Slack channel](https://ffconf.org/chat)** if anyone wants to do some light reading around the subjects.

I'm still filling out those last sessions, but I already know what I want to hear and it's on me to find those individuals to speak. That's also to say, that right now, there's no CFP (some people have asked on Twitter). If I change this, there'll be announcements [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ffconf) too.

If you ever have a suggestion for an amazing individual who you'd like to see speak at **ffconf** or an event like it (we're both well connected with other organisers), please feel free to reply to this email and let me know.

Otherwise, we'll see you soon, and the next email we should have a lovely web site to reveal üòç
