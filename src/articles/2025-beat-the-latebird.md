Don't just take our word for how awesome FFConf is, here are some attendee thoughts from previous years:

> Every time I've been to ffconf I've left with my faith fully restored in humanity and the web development community, and itching to try out new things. It's always an inspiring event in my calendar!

> Handcrafted, intimate, and full of thoughtful people.

> I don't often recommend conferences, and I'm not one for networking, but I get so much out of ffconf that I tell every engineer I meet "if you go to one conference this year, go to ffconf". I tell every junior engineer at work to go along, and everyone one of them comments on how much they loved it.

> Really great conference - I love how there is a mix of different types of talks. However, the best thing of all is just seeing fellow front end folks in general and feeling that collective positive buzz.

> It’s a wonderful conference with a clear emphasis on community, diversity and inclusivity. The result is an eclectic line up and an array of talks that validate, inspire and energise. If you’ve never been, I can’t recommend it enough.

This week Big AI released another AI browser, one that can browse for you and perform tasks. I'm not linking to them because I believe they're a real security risk that decades of work has gone into securing the web.

I (Remy) feel like it's our job to share with our less technically inclined friends and family that these browsers come with (pretty big) risks.

The first is from hijacking - which is [horribly simple](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386434090901671936/) to pull off. The second risk is the undoing of secure layers, and the LLM will now have clear text access to [your personal data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nichalley_hands-down-the-best-overview-of-the-intrinsic-activity-7343816273593569280-MDeO) (this is 2m30s video that's absolutely worth your time).

Then there are the AI companies saying how we can improve the compatibility with these browsers by using ARIA roles to "improve" the AI's understanding, and the almost inevitable side effect is that ARIA roles get abused by SEO hacking. Adrian Roselli has an [excellent write up](https://adrianroselli.com/2025/10/openai-aria-and-seo-making-the-web-worse.html):

>  SEO hacks have been keyword-stuffing alt text in images for literal decades. There is no way ARIA will get away unscathed. Every button, link, and div will be roled up to redundancy at best, and the wrong thing at worst.

There's also a [few tools](https://developers.netlify.com/guides/blocking-ai-bots-and-controlling-crawlers/) available to block the content stealing bots from training on your hard work.

It _is_ our job to make the web better, and that can also mean through sharing offline knowledge (which, FFConf is all about!).
