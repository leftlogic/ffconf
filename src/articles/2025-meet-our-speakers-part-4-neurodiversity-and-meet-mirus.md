## Latest Event News

Meet our speakers! We are welcoming Sacha Judd to FFConf to talk about "The Good Internet: How Fandom Can Reclaim the Web" If you're fed up with corporate walled gardens and hungry for a more authentic online experience, join Sacha's journey to bring back the good internet - a place fuelled by genuine community, creativity, and connection.

**Where do you recommend people start if they want to escape algorithmic feeds and reclaim a bit of online space for themselves?**

> I am going to talk about this! I think it starts as small as making something for yourself -- something weird or useful or funny or without purpose. And I think it starts with teaching other people how to do the same.

**The web can be a double-edged sword for marginalised communities—both a sanctuary and a target. How could we build personal online spaces that are safer and more expressive?**

> This is a great question, and it doesn't have easy answers. One of the real contradictions I explored in an earlier talk [I Still Believe in Heroes](https://www.sachajudd.com/heroes/) is that messy, unmoderated, public spaces like Twitter are terrible for underrepresented voices because they get harassed, drowned out, and driven away.
>
> But structured, moderated, controlled spaces often don’t allow underrepresented voices to call out racism, transphobia and misogyny without asking for permission. So much of this is how we build these spaces from the outset, setting expectations and creating inclusivity in the foundations (unlike, say, Substack).

Meet Sacha on 14th November, and you can [read Sacha's full interview](https://ffconf.org/articles/2025-meet-the-speaker-sacha/) on our website.

## From Our Archive

With the truly awful coverage of autism in the news recently, it only seems fit to highlight [Jonathan Fielding's](https://ffconf.org/talks/2023_jonathan/) excellent talk from 2023 called 'Embracing Neurodiversity in Tech: Building Empathy, Unveiling Strengths'.

From Jonathan, we learn that the autism spectrum isn't a line, but a circle where each individual has different strengths and challenges:

We also want everyone to use the _"Pacman"_ formation when in conversation at FFConf and leave a room for someone to join the group to foster our welcoming environment.

## Community News

We couldn't run this event without our sponsors so a massive thank you to [Mirus](https://www.wearemirus.com/) - a family run business who approach recruitment with care and consideration.

Mark, the co-founder, will be distributing the ice creams in the afternoon break and shared these words with us:

> At Mirus, we’ve been helping teams in design, product, data and technology find the right people for years. For us, it’s never just about filling a role, it’s about understanding fit, creating impact, and making the process feel simple and human.
>
> We are exploring how a human curated, AI-enabled, feedback-driven matching can shape the future of hiring, with transparency and speed at the centre. I’d love to get your thoughts at the conference, or feel free to connect with me directly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markatmirus/).
