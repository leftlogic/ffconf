We'd proud to announce our next speaker joining us for ffconf 2024 (and tease the 3rd speaker announcement).

As AI seems to either dominate or worm its way into every conversation around the web, Remy felt it was important to call in an expert in understanding it's use in accessibility.

L√©onie is an expert in her field of web accessibility and, Remy felt, the best person to answer the call.

Who: **L√©onie Watson**

What: ***AI and Accessibility: the Good, the Bad, and the Bollocks***

In this talk, L√©onie is going to cut through the clickbait, dodge the doomscrollers, and focus on the facts to bring you the good, the bad, and the bollocks of AI and accessibility.

You can visit [L√©onie's web site](https://tink.uk/) and follow her [on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@tink) where she posts but also shares useful accessibility links.

We also have our inclusion sponsorship positions, allowing your company to support our scholarship program, which **reserves 10% of the event attendance for marginalised groups** by providing tickets, travel, and accommodation - a meaningful cause to be associated with.
