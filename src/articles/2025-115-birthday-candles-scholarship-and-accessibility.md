## Latest Event News

Our beautiful venue, Duke of York's, is an integral part of the day, adding so much character and charm. It recently marked its **115th birthday** with a red carpet event (which of course Remy and Julie attended).

**Did you know** the Duke of York's is the UK's oldest purpose-built cinema and used to seat _800 people!_

## From Our Archive

Another anniversary - we have been running our scholarship scheme for [10 years](https://remysharp.com/2015/08/28/diversity-scholarships). The spark came from SassConf and hopefully has inspired other conferences to offer similar schemes.

We do not have a company sponsor again this year but we will continue to support this ourselves, along with ticket donations from individuals (shout out to Dave L, Amy H, Dave P and Daniel K).

A previous recipient generously wrote up their [experience](https://dev.to/calier/what-happened-at-my-first-tech-conference-spoiler-alert-nothing-bad-94f) with some kind words:

> Special shout-out here to those companies that provide sponsorship, and the individuals who purchase extra tickets so that those of us of more modest means can share the experience.
>
> Without your incredible generosity, people like me are going to continue to view tech conferences as intimidating and unattainable, so I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

## Community News

We couldnâ€™t run this event without our sponsors. A huge thank you to [Tetralogical](https://tetralogical.com/) for their work in making the web more accessible and for sharing the aims of our community â€” an open, welcoming and accessible web.

Tetralogical just relaunched their self-led [training courses](https://tetralogical.com/services/training-courses/). These courses have been redesigned with instructional design in mind, are fully accessible and more. [You can read more on their LinkedIn update](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7374097322391097344).

They have also been doing [some thinking](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2025/08/08/accessibility-and-the-agentic-web/) around Agentic AI and how it might change the web as we know it and with that how we make things accessible.
