Sareh Heidari starts us out with [***Digital exclusion in healthcare & how to change it***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi1NXGgsM3s&list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9afwuEl1NolNpvd0yNWc8E&index=7), asking questions that perhaps we've not considered:

> So you don't need to take a whole morning off for a doctor's appointment - great! Using tech for healthcare can speed up so many interactions & some changes are here to stay.

Finally, to close our day was Ruth John with her [***Day Disco***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SLwgKAz_P0&list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9afwuEl1NolNpvd0yNWc8E&index=8) who declared!

> Welcome to your obligatory FFConf browser disco! This talk will cover the current state of media APIs and what's coming next.

And that's it. All our talks are live and available to watch online - or if you're into the audio, these are also available in [our archive](/talks/?filter=&years=2022)

As for us, we're taking a break for the Christmas holidays and we'll be rebooting our FFConf brains in January to start prep'ing for FFConf 2023!
