## Latest Event News

Meet our Speakers! We are welcoming Sergès with their FFConf talk: _"You're in a Code Cult (And That's OK)"_.

**When you need a break from all the 'code cults', what's your favourite way to remind yourself that it’s all just people (and fun) in the end?**

> As a JavaScript dev, I get roasted constantly - especially by PHP and Java developers. But at the end of the day, even they have to grudgingly touch JavaScript when their boss needs something on the frontend. So I laugh. Because JavaScript won. HAHA.
>
> What keeps me grounded is not taking it all too seriously. I've come to understand that in the history of software engineering, languages come and go. Trends rise and die. The key is to adapt, and not get too emotionally attached to any one technology. It's all just part of the cycle.

**What do you hope people take away from your talk when they next find themselves deep in a flame war over tabs vs spaces?**

> You want me to spoil my own talk? Rude. 😄
>
>But okay - here's a teaser: I'm actually pro-arguing, as long as it's constructive and leads to better outcomes. Healthy debate is good! What matters is that we don't forget we're all just nerds trying to build cool stuff.
>
>For the rest, you'll have to watch the talk. I promise it'll be fun and enlightening.

FFConf isn't just about the latest technical advances. It is about being human and embracing vulnerability.

Sharon Steed's talk [Engaging Empathy](https://ffconf.org/talks/empathy) demonstrates this beautifully. Sharon illustrates how we can communicate and collaborate with patience, perspective and connection.

I, Remy, have been thinking lately about _vibe coding_ (I feel like as an industry we're being forced to constantly think about AI, perhaps [we're being force fed](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-big-tech-is-force-feeding-us)).

After using Claude Code to build niche tools, it's easy to see the appeal. Though recently coined, “vibe coding” still means different things to different people. Simon Willison [writes](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/) that it is:

> building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes

I also recently posted my own thoughts [comparing vibe coding to Ed 209](https://remysharp.com/2025/07/18/vibe-coding-and-robocop) (for those of you not old enough to get the reference, I included links to videos!).

We’re used to adding 3rd party tools to our workflow - so how do we feel about letting an AI agent access our machines? I wonder how many people are vetting the system access that an AI agent has to their machines.

There's certainly a growing number of (fascinating and farcical) failures: [entire databases deleted](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bad-vibes-how-an-ai-agent-coded-its-way-to-disaster/) (probably the most high profile facepalm), [computers wiped](https://www.404media.co/hacker-plants-computer-wiping-commands-in-amazons-ai-coding-agent/), [emails leaked](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7352836737691217920/) and [let me just remove those tests](https://bsky.app/profile/johnwards.bsky.social/post/3lunddi5pvs2j) 😂

What about you? Have you given it a try? Perhaps you work on the web but not a coder, would is helping you?
