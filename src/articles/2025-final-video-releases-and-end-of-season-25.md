## The last of 2025

This is our final newsletter of 2025 and with that we present the final sessions from our 2025 edition of FFConf.

There was many proud parents in the room as [Surya Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anF9c2zq1BM&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=7) (16 years old) confidently took to the stage to fulfil his dream and led us on his coding journey from 6 to 16 years old. As our industry continues to exist, it's the young people who will breathe life into it, so Surya's experience is essential.

We were delighted that [Sacha Judd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq0WjXn0N9k&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=8) was able to join us all the way from New Zealand! She filled our hearts with the joy of what the Good Internet is. Not just a nostalgic memory but alive today and just as weird as always.

Watch [Surya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anF9c2zq1BM&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=7) and [Sacha's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq0WjXn0N9k&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=8) talks today.

## Huge Thanks

Thank you so much for all your support this year, it really means the world to both of us. We are grateful for every ticket sale, share on social media, recommendation to a friend or colleague, donation to the scholarship fund - it means so much to a family run conference like ourselves.

You won't hear from us again until May 2026 when we start a new season, so with that, we want to with you all the very best for 2026 and hope to see you on Friday 13th November next year (if not before!).

– Remy & Julie 👋🎄
