We have worked with [talented photographers](/history) over the years giving us their time and skills to capture our special days.

We shan't bore you with them all but if you want to see how things have changed over the last two decades, compare [2009](https://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/albums/72157622854415414/with/4128345548)  - our very first event, the one where we all look very young - and [last year](https://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/albums/72177720321895884/) where everyone has grown up!

## Community News

Since [Amber Shand](https://ffconf.org/talks/2023_amber/) spoke at FFConf in 2023, she has gone on to build her own community called 'She Bytes Back" that she told us was inspired by her experience at FFConf.

Amber has run 14 fantastic events and built a community of 3,000 women in tech. You can get on her [mailing list](https://www.shebytesback.com/events) for updates on new events and how you can get involved too.
