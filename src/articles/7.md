With ffconf nearing, it's time to time to start talking about who's talking.

**You can get your Friday (sold out)** [**Thursday ticket today**](https://ffconf.org/tickets)

As I talked about last week, the curation process for events is extremely important to me, and this year, every single speaker has been individually sought out and asked if they can address a specific topic.

The first two speakers I'd like to introduce you to are Lisi Linhart and Willian Martins.

Lisi is speaking about Web Animation. It was when I saw this beautiful animation that Lisi had created (below), and then spotted that it was a web animation (from the description) it blew my mind as to how seamless and smooth it all ran. I personally still shy away from the animation APIs because I've really no idea what's involved.

Willian is bringing us all up to speed with the next JavaScript specifications. What's coming next. I'm sure a number of you live in Babel-Land covered by the fabled Mount Webpack, but for the rest of us, this kind of syntax needs some introduction:

```js
1::plus(2)::times(4)::div(3)::minus(1);
```

So Willian is going to give us a guided tour of what's coming next.

**More speakers soon!**

I'll be in touch again soon with more speakers and why and what they're speaking about. I can assure you that ffconf v10 is going to be a great day of speakers, a superb range of content and the chance to meet like-minded webby people.

Until next time,
