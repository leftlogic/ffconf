## 2025 News

In our second post event newsletter, we move onto the next two sessions, pre lunch slot where we look at web components, React teams and… cults!

[Hannah Clarke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOHLNP-_Oi0) talked about her experience bringing web components to a React based team and the process integration both from the software side but also from the team adoption perspective.

Followed by [Sergès Goma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab0tDcxmc64) fun and funny talk about cults which dovetailed perfectly into Hannah's talk. She argued that we're all in a cult (to some degree) and touched on the gatekeeping that was also touched on in Hellen's talk about team diversity.
