## Latest Event News

We cannot believe there's just 8 days left until [the conference](https://2025.ffconf.org) next week! Since we started in May, we have sent out 20 newsletters and we hope you have found them informative and interesting - your feedback is welcomed!

I (Julie) met someone from the tech industry the other week, who had never been to FFConf but had heard of it as a "code event". This conversation inspired Remy to write up his [thoughts on how FFConf has changed](https://remysharp.com/2025/10/27/how-has-ffconf-changed-since-it-was-known-as-full-frontal) since we started back in 2009.

## From Our Archive

Our friends at [Brighton Codebar](https://codebar.io/brighton) have not only allocated some of our scholarship tickets but they are also hosting the pre conference coffee morning so wanted to highlight Kimberley Cook's talk [0 - 27,000 people! Growing a global community over 11 years](https://ffconf.org/talks/2024_kimberley/).

Kimberley shares how Codebar was started by a small group of women who were annoyed being the only women in their companies and being surrounded by white people and wanted to make a change. I love how they changed the format after the very first meet up when people were too afraid to ask questions and straight away they moved to the unique student/coach set up.

There's just one last newsletter before the conference, it'll be short as we'll be super busy, but our final speaker interview will also drop (and it's a good one!).
