Set your alarms, schedule your reminders and tell your friends: tickets go live **18th July at 10am UK time**.

That's right, next week! If you didn't manage to catch one of our peek-a-boo tickets last month in the 30 minutes they sold out, then you'll want to secure your ticket next week!

Half of the talk content is online and we'll be revealing more details in the coming weeks, but maybe you can guess our speakers just from their titles? 🤔😁 Take a peek here: [2022.ffconf.org](https://2022.ffconf.org)

We're very excited to be back in person and we're really looking forward to seeing you all (yes, every one of you), to share a day to be excited and inspired about working on the web, with the web and with each other.

So, set those reminders: 18 July 10am UK time.

We'll catch you next week ♥️
