**Ire Aderinokun**: Future proof CSS

Ire's origin story: _I was a little too obsessed with Neopets as a teenager and had to build the best profile page. Once I started down that rabbit hole I was hooked!_

Remy invited Ire to talk because under this CSS-centric title, there's some really useful and important messages about accessibility. Ire has also created a very thorough resource for web developers on Notion called _[Frontend Developer Learning Guide](https://ire.notion.site/Frontend-Developer-Learning-Guide-39e189f4a49b4fcb9a6304ebf1f327a9)_ - even if you're seasoned, check it out.

**Jonathan Fielding**: Embracing Neurodiversity in Tech: Building Empathy, Unveiling Strengths

Jonathan's origin story: _Escaping from an after school club I found my way back to my classroom where a student teacher showed me BASIC on a Acorn._

Jonathan has been a long time regular of FFConf - so much so, he's even managed to bag himself a coveted [FFConf t-shirt](https://twitter.com/jonthanfielding). Take a moment to check out [his website too](https://www.jonathanfielding.com/).
