As promised we'll start pulling up the curtain on our speakers now that all the content and sessions are in place.

Maybe you wonder why we've obscured our speakers at launch like this for so many years?

FFConf sets the focus on the content of the conference, over the individual speakers… the [greater good](https://youtu.be/5u8vd_YNbTw?si=rNtToYSptZ720-aU&t=4) and all that. It shows the strength of FFConf as a content driven event 💪

🎟️ 👉 You can still **[buy a ticket today](https://ffconf.org/tickets)** too.

Without further ado, let us introduce the first of our speakers.

**Amber Shand**: Imposter syndrome, overworking, and working environments

Amber's origin story: _I was told that because I didn't have a Computer Science degree, I wouldn't be able to learn how to code, I didn't listen and I'm now a multi award software engineer, keynote speaker and consultant_

Amber has lots of links worth exploring, so we'll point you straight to Amber's [about pages](https://ambershand.co.uk/about/), do explore.

**Maggie Appleton**: The Expanding Dark Forest and Generative AI

Maggie's origin story: _Built an elaborate Neopets page using only the HTML `<table>` element for positioning and layout. Graduated to maximalist design aesthetics and animated cursors with CSS on MySpace._

Check out [Maggie's web site](https://maggieappleton.com/), Remy found the patterns section particularly interesting.
