As our news is all about community and events, it felt fitting to point you this week to Jenny Wong's wonderful talk from 2018, where they ask: [Is it possible to build a truly diverse community?](https://ffconf.org/talks/is-it-possible-to-build-a-truly-diverse-community/)

If you listen closely to Jenny's talk, you might spot small changes that FFConf made to make for a more inclusive and friendly event. We also credit Jenny coining _"Lunch with Future Friends"_ (we used Lunch with Strangers previously).


## Community News

A core part of the web community are the events that bring people together in real life. We wanted to celebrate some of these events:

- [WDC](https://webdevconf.com/) - Long standing Bristol web event, Remy will be doing a lightning talk, though on Gameboys and not JavaScript ðŸ¤·
- [State of the Browser](https://2026.stateofthebrowser.com/) - a Saturday event in London, exceptional value and strong on the accessible and open web.
- [Web Day Out](https://webdayout.com/) - in March next year (expect what it says on the tin) from fellow Brightonian Jeremy Keith at Clearleft.

Of course more other events we love, though their dates are now behind us, so you'll need to look out next year for All Day Hey, Pixel Pioneers, Front End North â€¦ and others?
