First is Alice Barlett's [***Getting more from Git***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ4IdcrOUz0&list=PLXmT1r4krsTrR6khetJSVQqulyFbxmZNG&index=4), which describes their talk with:

> Git is like a Swiss Army Knife for telling the story of your project. Yet most of us are only using the big knife and maybe the scissors to fudge our code into version control. In this talk we're going to learn about some more advanced Git commands and some history too.

Next is Laura Kalbag on [***8 Unbelievable Things You Never Knew About Tracking***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkeGGNdOv4g&list=PLXmT1r4krsTrR6khetJSVQqulyFbxmZNG&index=4):

> The web, and big tech at large, is tracking our every move, habit, and facial expression. As developers who are also users, we both contribute to the surveillance system and are exploited by it. But it doesn't have to be this way.

We'll be publishing the next talks next week - until then 👋 have a great weekend.
