No doubt you're all settled back into 2025, for better or worse. However, I bring good news: all the videos have now been edited, encoded, captioned and uploaded ready to be released to you.

So that we don't overwhelm your week with videos - because who's really got time to watch through eight conference talks right away, we're going to release them out to you in pairs.

The first release will include Olu's "Build Better Webs" and then Léonie's accessibility talk entitled "AI and Accessibility: the Good, the Bad, and the Bollocks".

That will be release next Monday. I'm going to block out two of my lunch times next week to re-watch these - I know they're valuable to my day job.

Please help us spread the word, folks can get the [announcement first on our newsletter](https://ffconf.org/news/), or via [our socials](https://bsky.app/profile/ffconf.org) or just revisit the entire [archive at ffconf.org](https://ffconf.org/talks/).

Oh, and maybe pop [this date](https://2025.ffconf.org/) in your diary too…
