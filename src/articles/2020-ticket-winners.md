As part of the 2019 edition of {% ffconf %} we announced that anyone who blogged about their experience of the event would be entered into a draw for a free ticket to {% ffconf %} 2020.

Firstly we'd like to thank all those bloggers who participated and we can tell you that we (Julie and myself, Remy) read every post - so thank you so much.

So, the winners of the draw are:

- [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/)
- [Josh Hudson](https://wearetilt.com/ffconf-2019-developers-conference/)

Congratulations to you both - and we'll be in touch via email.

If you want to see how the winners were selected (the short version is: randomly) then I made a [screencast of my process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3INrvIw5-2w) using a tool called [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq):
