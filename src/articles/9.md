**Jenny** is a self confessed open source community junkie, in fact I've seen Jenny at a number of the jsconf conferences myself. Jenny has a tonne of experience attending and organising events, which is why Jenny's talk will look at how we can create welcoming and diverse environments.

I'm certain that even FFConf won't tick every point that Jenny covers, **but this is the point of FFConf: to better ourselves**.

**Eleanor** has the honour of answering my questions about _The Rise of the Machines üò±!_ ‚Ä¶well, not quite, but AI and Machine Learning in the browser. My brain aches when I see some (or any) of the projects that run in a browser using AI. Eleanor and friends also run [aijs.rocks](https://twitter.com/EleanorHaproff/status/1035068222087811072), a site dedicated to showcasing curated AI-powered JavaScript projects - do check it out:
