Fresh off the "publish this video" button and an excellent start to your week, we have Amy and Mike's talks from FFConf 2024.

Amy reprised and updated her "It all means nothing in the end" talk especially for FFConf, a self reflecting (whilst also funny‚Ä¶possibly in a dark way) excellent talk with some useful advice throughout. [Watch Amy's talk now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTFWgEBVf6Q&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=5).

Then Mike was asked to bring his scepticism skills to FFConf. He starts with a non-exhaustive list of biases and showed some excellent practical examples of how they work and how we can reframe our thinking. [Watch Mike's talk on debugging the mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIEtS-nBdlc&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=6).

That's it for this week. Next week and our last set: Michael Kibedi on Death and technology, and finally Imran Afzal on _The art of reflection_.
