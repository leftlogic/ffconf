Where you run your event is (or should be) intentional. **{% ffconf %}** has two very special, and intentional locations. Two locations that I care about very much:

1.  Duke of York's Picturehouse
2.  Brighton, UK

After the first few years of **{% ffconf %}**, when we started selling out very quickly, people would often ask myself and Julie whether we were going to go to a bigger venue. At the time, I believe we could have (reasonably) easily grown the event to hold 600, maybe 800 people in a bigger venue, but it just wouldn't have the same personality and absolutely amazing feel of the Duke of York's.

The cinema was opened on 22 September 1910, and the structure is largely the same (including the balcony box that some of you clever folks find!). Not only is our venue historic, beautiful and pioneering, but it boasts to be one of the most comfortable venues!

Then there's Brighton itself. Brighton is an amazing little city, I think, punching well above it's weight. We _could_ run our event in London and appeal to more of the big city corporates, but Brighton is my home town and an extremely welcoming, open and diverse city.

The city has many many digital business here ranging from large to small. Although our event is just one day (though, remember, _repeated twice!_), there's lots of opportunities to head down here for visits or even pick up a new job or career in Brighton.

In particular, two of our sponsors based in Brighton (well‚Ä¶one is 15 minutes outside, but close enough that we'll let them off) have open job opportunities.

**ProdPad** is looking for both front end developers, and backend developers with JavaScript and Node experience to work on their slick product management product: **[find out more here](https://www.prodpad.com/about-us/jobs/)**

**Amex** (American Express) - their UK engineering team is hiring a full range of positions with the chance to make a digital difference to massive audience of customers. Amex are supporters of open source, and in particular have created their own "inner source" environment to promote the sharing of code internally in support their own technology solutions **[Find out more here](https://jobs.americanexpress.com/tech/jobs?location=United%20Kingdom)**

So, come join us down in sunny (and yes, often rainy) Brighton!
