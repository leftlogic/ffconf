ðŸ—£ Our call for papers is [**officially open**](https://ffconf.org/cfp) for speaking at the 2024 event.

Over the years we've had some amazing CFPs, and if there's a topic you feel passionate about, I'm sure we want to hear about it too.

As a speaker, new or thoroughly seasoned, we treat you with the same respect, and you can read [our promise to you here](https://ffconf.org/articles/cfp/#our-promise-to-you).

If you've already got a ticket and your CFP is selected, of course we'll refund you (if you don't have a ticket, [what are you waiting for](https://2024.ffconf.org/) - tickets are LIVE!).

Here's some ideas that Remy would love to see, just to get you started:

- How to think critically / being sceptical
- How our development practices are changing / "How I've changed my development process over X years"
- An introduction to the Indie Web: blogs, web mentions, web rings, web components
- The art of giving and receiving feedback

[And many more here](https://ffconf.org/articles/cfp/#topics-i'm-interested-in-hearing-about) - but again, they're just ideas!

You can apply here and find out more about our entire CFP and what it offers: **[ffconf.org/cfp](https://ffconf.org/cfp)**

We'll see you in November.
