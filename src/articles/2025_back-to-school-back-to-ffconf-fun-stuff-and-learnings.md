## Latest Event News

Welcome Back! Our household is full of back to school vibes as our youngest starts secondary school today ðŸ¥¹

In the coming weeks we'll be sharing more about our current speakers and introducing the rest of our line up.


## From Our Archive

Using our back to school energy, we are re-watching Tim Holman's talk
[Weird Web & Curious Creation](https://ffconf.org/talks/weird-web/). Tim loves to make things and his message is: look at what inspires you, indulge yourself, ideas can be big and small whilst being [mindfully weird](https://thezen.zone/).

This was from the "double FFConf" days where we repeated the event, and _both_ days we were in tears from how fun and silly Tim's talk was!

If you find you've got time to kill or you need some restbite from the current mundane, checkout [Tim's "I Build" section](https://tholman.com/) - it's fab!


## Community News

Since we've been away it's been nice to look back on the updates to the web, or rather specifically: browsers and what we can do.

Although I (Remy) am not a fan of "you don't need X for that" posts, but [Lyra Rebane](https://bsky.app/profile/rebane2001.bsky.social)'s CSS focused post [You no longer need JavaScript](https://lyra.horse/blog/2025/08/you-dont-need-js/) is jampacked full of useful content. Two <abbr title="things I learnt">TIL</abbr>s for me: nesting media queries and the `lvh`, `svh`, and `dvh` units.


Then there's the [URLPattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern/pathname) which I know is going to save JavaScript developers from the hellscape that is the URL regualr expression.


Then I stumbled upon the [Summarize API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Summarizer#examples) (and I have mixed feelings about AI shipping in the browser), and it has already landed in Chrome stable (along with two [other language based APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in-apis#api_status)) meaning a relatively small amount of JavaScript gives me on-device summarisation, possibly a nice addition to something like an RSS reader (or even this email!).

That's all from us this week. We're now returning to our regular newsletter schedule of every Thursday with our FFConf news and we'll continue to introduce the rest of our speakers in the coming weeks.
