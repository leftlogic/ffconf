Remy is building the new ffconf website, as you know, we like to have a brand new design every year (created every year by [Chris Mahon](https://chrismahon.com/))

Here is a sneak peak:

To mark World Environment Day, we want to celebrate [Natalia Waniczek's talk in 2022](https://ffconf.org/talks/2022_lil_natw_talk/)

Natalie highlights some quick actions to understand how your work is impacting the environment and what you can do to reduce that impact/footprint:

- [Estimate your web page carbon footprint](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)
- [Check if your website runs on green energy](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/)
- [And if it doesn't, then change it!](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/directory/)

A frustration fuelled blog post came out this week from [Fly.io](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) originally titled "You're all nuts" (later retitled to narrow down who exactly, is nutsâ€¦). The article is long, impassioned and rather than moving the needle on the conversation, manages rather more to draw a line in the sand.

Obviously the reality lays in the greys whilst this week this particular post helped push out those people further from the middle. Myself, I'm on the sceptic's side with a heavy concern for ethics without any real answers.

Also late last week the CEO of Anthropic (responsible for Claude AI) was [interviewed](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/29/tech/ai-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-unemployment) saying that he wants to raise the alarm on the potential of 20% unemployment due to AI. Novara Media have a [good digest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLCAWSWbWfg) on this interview too.

Ultimately the concern (to me, Remy) is that AI could pull the career ladder up on leaving the entry level positions null and void, compounded by the fact that companies are using AI as a reason to let their teams go [rather than using AI to supplement](https://bsky.app/profile/cfiesler.bsky.social/post/3lqplx3hbtp2m).

_We would love to continue this particular conversation at FFConf, if you think you can contribute, please let us know on our [call for proposals](https://ffconf.org/cfp)_.
