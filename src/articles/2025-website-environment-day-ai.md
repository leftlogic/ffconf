To mark World Environment Day, we want to celebrate [Natalia Waniczek's excellent session from 2022](https://ffconf.org/talks/2022_lil_natw_talk/).

Natalia's scary _and_ hopeful talk highlights quick actions to help understand how your work is intertwined with the environment and what you can do to reduce your impact:

- [Estimate your web page carbon footprint](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)
- [Check if your website runs on green energy](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/)
- [And if it doesn't, then change it!](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/tools/directory/)

A frustration fuelled blog post came out this week from [Fly.io](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) originally titled "You're all nuts" (later retitled to narrow down who exactly, is nutsâ€¦). The article is long, impassioned but rather than moving the needle on the conversation, manages rather more to draw a line in the sand.

We're on the AI sceptic's side with a heavy concern for ethics without any real answers. The reality of daily AI use lays in the greys, but this particular post helped to show how polarised we're becoming.

Additionally, last week the CEO of Anthropic (responsible for Claude AI) was [interviewed](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/29/tech/ai-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-unemployment) saying that he wants to raise the alarm on the potential of 20% unemployment due to AI. Novara Media have a [good digest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLCAWSWbWfg) on this interview too.

Ultimately the concern for us is that AI could pull the career ladder up on the entry level positions leaving them null and void, compounded by the fact that companies are using AI as a reason to let their teams go [rather than using AI to supplement them](https://bsky.app/profile/cfiesler.bsky.social/post/3lqplx3hbtp2m).

_We would love to continue this particular conversation at FFConf, if you think you can contribute, please let us know on our [call for proposals](https://ffconf.org/cfp)_.
