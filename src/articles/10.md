This very time next week I'll be running a workshop on universal React with a room full of eager-to-learn bunnies. I â€“ AM â€“ EXCITED.

There's **[22 tickets left for Thursday](https://ffconf.org/tickets)** (and at time of writing [a single Friday ticket](https://ffconf.org/tickets) has become available) - so if you were on the fence or badgering your manager and they've forgotten: time for action!

With that in mind, I'm very pleased to introduce the final speakers of our lineup for 2018, Charlie Owen and Tim Holman:

**Charlie** is going to be fighting the good fight for the web this year at ffconf. I'm pretty sure most of you dear reader love the web and want to make it a better place, and Charlie has a bit of (excellent) soapboxing to do that I'd highly encourage you to take back to your colleagues and preach ðŸ™Œ.

**Tim** has been asked if he could talk to the amazing and beautiful things the web has to offer - both creatively and just as pure fun. Tim has a fairly large collection of fun projects, one such is [inspiring.online](https://inspiring.online) that curates those projects that exist purely to remind people like me, that the web is a GREAT place to make and share things.
