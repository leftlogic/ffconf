We're proud to announce our next speaker joining us for FFConf 2024.

We all know a good CV is (supposed) to include "good communicator", but in reality how often do we review that. Are we any good at giving feedback, or more importantly, _receiving it_?

We're pleased to have Andy Bell (_not the lead singer of Erasure!_) join our family of speakers to help address this problem and how we can become better work colleagues.

Who: **Andy Bell**

What: ***Get the core right and the resilient code will follow***

Web developers often focus only on technical skills. Andy is going to show a better approach by improving planning, core skills, and feedback exchange to produce simpler, more resilient codebases.

Check out Andy's [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) web site, an excellent resource for his own newsletter, constant collection of links, and his blog posts.
