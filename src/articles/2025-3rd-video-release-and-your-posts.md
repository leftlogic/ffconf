## 2025 News

In our third post event newsletter, we have enjoyed lunch (the Lunch with Future Friends was extremely popular this year) and we're back in our seats for the next two sessions.

[Asim Hussain](https://youtu.be/Qko6e2VpjIg?si=amA75WMcQyWOhuVY) told us "Don't be an Idiot" on how AI can, and is, being used to democratise big decisions, putting much more nuance in the decisions offered to people.

Followed by [Jessica Rose and Eda Eren](https://youtu.be/rsV3fC1p90o?si=8dgwF9nyq6PCGRLt). Told from the perspective of a senior and junior and what are the lasting impacts on relying (or being pushed into) AI tools. Very much the argument of shallow learning versus deep (human) learning through experience.
