Who: **Amy Hupe**

What: ***It all means nothing in the end***

What do you do when you've attached your sense of self to work, and work suddenly feels meaningless? In this talk, Amy explores burnout, purpose and making meaning in an increasingly confusing and calamitous world.

Aside from being a design systems pro (working for GDS and being content lead for their [design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)), Amy also hosted an excellent podcast last year called [Systems of Harm](https://systems-of-harm.fireside.fm/), with 6 episodes asking how we can work to design more inclusive experiences. Definitely check those out.

## üíû Support and sponsor ffconf

We have some fantastic sponsorship opportunities available with significant visibility during the event. One example is our famous ice-cream sponsorship, which includes featuring your branding on our ice-cream cartons and exposure through photos and direct engagement with attendees.

We also have our inclusion sponsorship positions, allowing your company to support our scholarship program, which **reserves 10% of the event attendance for marginalised groups** by providing tickets, travel, and accommodation - a meaningful cause to be associated with.
