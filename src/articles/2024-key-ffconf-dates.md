We're thrilled to announce that {% ffconf %} will be back on **Friday, 8th November 2024**. Tickets will remain priced at last year's rate of £249+VAT. We'll be announcing ticket release date in our coming newsletters.

As with previous years, all the talks from 2023 are accessible on our [{% ffconf %} archive site](https://ffconf.org/talks/?filter=&years=2023). Last year featured some truly exceptional presentations, and we strongly recommend taking the time to watch or revisit them.

## We Need Your Support!

We're excited to be opening our Call for Papers soon and to continue our popular scholarship programme, now in its 8th year. Keep your eyes peeled for that in our newsletter and socials.

More critically, we depend on our sponsors to bring this event to life.
If you or your company are keen to support {% ffconf %}, we would love to hear from you. By sponsoring, you'll be supporting the web development community but also gain valuable exposure. We offer a variety of sponsorship packages, tailored to suit different needs and levels of engagement. [Please email us at events@leftlogic.com](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=sponsorship).

Keep an eye out for more updates on {% ffconf %} 2024, and follow us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ffconf) or [Mastodon](https://social.ffconf.org/@ffconf) for the latest news.
