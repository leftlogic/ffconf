Today our scholarship application closes and we've received over 100 applications.

Our scheme is now in its 5th year and ours is one of the few conferences who also offer ticket, travel _and_ accommodation costs to reduce the barriers of entry.

We're also extremely proud to know that other events have used our scholarship scheme as a template for their own events - go team inclusion 💪

We all have our part to play in working towards inclusive and safe environments that can foster diversity. For us, Julie and Remy, our conference's scholarship is our platform for just that.

Our scholarship (and many others we've seen) are open to:

- People of colour
- People with disabilities
- People who identify as LGBTQIA+
- Women
- People who work for nonprofit/educational/government institutions with limited funds
- People who are currently unemployed / underemployed

It is **truly an honour** to be able to provide scholarships to individuals, and to have ffconf play part of their journey.

This is what one scholarship recipient had to say about ffconf last year:

> This conference is different. First it is very family oriented which brings together innovative coding and great speakers to inspire, motivate and share with its community.
>
> It is run as a partnership with Julie and her husband Remy who work very hard to make the conference run smoothly, enjoyable and valuable.
>
> The eclectic mix of talks which I have kept record of on my tweets to refer back to as there was so much knowledge, and experience gathered in one room.

It's also with yours and your company's help that we're able to make this happen. More specifically, thank you to the 5 individuals who bought tickets and the 8 individuals who made a donation towards travel and accommodation.

We couldn't do it without the help of our sponsors as their support means can budget for the needs of the programme.

Those sponsors include:

- [Nexmo](https://developer.nexmo.com/)
- [Prodpad](https://www.prodpad.com/about-us/jobs/)
- [Samsung](https://samsunginter.net/)
- [Unmade](https://www.unmade.com/)

Please also take a moment to read these messages from a few of those sponsors about _why_ they wanted to sponsor ffconf and support the scholarship programme:

> ProdPad is passionate in supporting underrepresented communities within the tech industry. It's important that our sector remains forward-thinking, evolves with the times, and supports those that need it.
>
> The ffconf represents that, and has created wonderful opportunities for all types of tech-loving people.

> Unmade is a growing company, and as part of our efforts to be more engaged in the tech community, conference sponsorship was something we knew we wanted to do. When we came across the opportunity to offer scholarships for ffconf, it was a no brainer (some of us have attended in the past and would highly recommend).
>
> Inclusively, diversity, and sustainability are fundamental principles we're trying to abide by as a team, and as we grow, and we can't think of many better ways to do that than helping create opportunities for others.
>
> We're excited to be a part of this years event, we hope you enjoy it, and we look forward to seeing you in November!
