The important date that everyone I meet in person hounds me for is "when will tickets be live?". The answer depends entirely on us building a website, but as the wheels are in motion, here's the important date for your calendars:

## ðŸ‘‰ **{% ffconf %} 2019 tickets are released on Tuesday, 16 July 2019 at 10am BST** ðŸ‘ˆ

Set your clocks, add the calendar events, do what you gotta do!

## A sneak at 2019's website

The new 2019 website is now in the works - if you've followed our event over the years, you'll know that every single year has it's own unique design and it's own unique {% ffconf %} logo.

I live streamed building out the backend code infrastructure for the website, which [you can watch on youtube](https://youtu.be/yyVqjw3Jn18) (there's some questionable language, rushed coding and talk of cats - so fair warning).

Then the frontend implementation work is handed over to [Giulia Alfonsi](https://twitter.com/electric_g) for our ticket release date.

Here's a preview of the 2019 design (bear in mind that we use last year speaker details as placeholder):

## Introducing: The Archive

As last year was our 10th {% ffconf %} since launching in 2009 and we had collected so much amazing content, it stood to reason that the full archive should be released and made available at [https://ffconf.org](https://ffconf.org).

The archive includes:

- 10 years of talks, a total of [78 talks](https://ffconf.org/talks)
- Audio for every single talk, and video for 56 of them (we started recording video in 2012)
- Articles and blogs that you've been posting (and [RSS](https://ffconf.org/articles.xml) to keep up to date)
- Some of our favourite [tweets](https://ffconf.org/tweets/) and [photos](https://ffconf.org/photos/)
- A little [history](https://ffconf.org/history/)
- An [API](https://ffconf.org/api)
- Source code on [Github](https://github.com/leftlogic/ffconf) and made with [11ty](https://11ty.io)

So take a peruse and enjoy, and set your clocks for ticket launch!
