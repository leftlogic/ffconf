## Applications

{% ffconf %} has been running a full [scholarship programme](https://ffconf.org/scholarship/) since 2015 and this year we continue to do so.

Scholarships are available for anyone in an under-represented group in tech. This includes (but is not limited to): people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, people who identify as women and people with disabilities.

We've seen so many individuals come through our programme and many of them share how it helped them:

> The inspirational speakers and welcoming community were a big part of giving me the confidence to keep coding, attend bootcamp and become a developer. Cheers, hope everyone has a great time @{% ffconf %} ðŸ˜Š

We still have a few places available and applications close on October 13th, so please [apply today](https://ffconf.org/scholarship/), travel and hotel expenses are covered for individuals who need it.

## How you can help

Financial support is the starting place - because it allows us to create a sustainable budget for the scholarship scheme:

1. Your company can sponsor {% ffconf %} under our [scholarship sponsor package](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=Request%20for%20sponsor%20pack%20%5B2023%5D).
2. You, or your company can [donate towards our scholarship](https://ffconf.org/tickets) fund. For example, Â£300 would cover a ticket, Â£1,000 can help 3 individuals *and* cover their travel and hotel.
3. You can actively spread the word about our scholarship programme (either to support it or for individuals to benefit from it).

One of {% ffconf %}'s core values is to help change the face of the web industry - to pull in those people from marginalised communities and to drastically reduce the barrier to entry. Doing this year on year, partly supported through our scholarship programme, I believe, helps to normalise a diverse web community.

## Scholarship sponsors

Legal & General have supported our scholarship programme again this year, and as you've read their support is highly valued, please take a moment to read their message:

> We're delighted to announce that Legal & General will once again be sponsoring this year's {% ffconf %}. We'll be offering scholarships so we can ensure that the brightest young minds from a variety of backgrounds are able to contribute to crucial conversations about the future of the web.
>
> We have first-hand experience of this event and, as a result, we're delighted to partner with {% ffconf %}. We're proud to work alongside the organisers to make sure this year's conference is the most successful so far!

Thanks for taking the time to read this post, again: creating a diverse web community is incredibly important to us and this is just one of the places where we can (all) have a direct impact.
