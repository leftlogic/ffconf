Our penultimate round of videos, the start of our afternoon back in November are now online and available to watch here:

[![The FFConf 2022 playlist](/images/articles/2022-talks-3.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9afwuEl1NolNpvd0yNWc8E)

We returned with Lily Madar's [***Programming with Yarn***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcbg_mCQOHs&list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9afwuEl1NolNpvd0yNWc8E&index=5)

> Crochet and other yarn crafts can be viewed as a form of programming. Without realising it, crocheters interpret their own patterns, thus becoming "computers". This talk explores the analogies between a craft and what we know of programming.

Then was Natalia Waniczek on [***Working towards a greener world from behind the keyboard***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS-3bFo1XHA&list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9afwuEl1NolNpvd0yNWc8E&index=6) who says:

> In what ways tech is affecting the environment & climate change? We'll discuss processes which devs can use in their work to create a greener web and implementable systematic changes within an organisation that'd make a positive impact on the world.

The last part of our day will be published later this week and I hope you're able to work your way through our amazing talks.
