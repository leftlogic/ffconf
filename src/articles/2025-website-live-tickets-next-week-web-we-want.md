## Latest Event News

The [2025 web site](Https://2025.ffconf.org) is now live (under the hood, it's using lots of CSS clamp and P3 colour space, so Remy has really upgraded his skills…finally).

The first three of eight talks are also live, and our [CFP](https://ffconf.org/cfp) remains open until all sessions are allocated.

So check out the website, set your alarm for 11am on 26th June for our first ticket release, and we will see you in Brighton on 14th November!

One question we get throughout the years is: _what does the FF stand for in FFConf?_

Remy would often reply with "whatever you need it to mean", but for us, Remy & Julie, it means _Friends Forever_.

Our first event was back in 2009 and seeing familiar faces join us over the years through the many ups and downs we've all faced, through the industry changing and all of us growing older, many, many of you have come to be our real friends. FFConf continues to treasure that aspect of the day and we love welcoming new faces every year.

A few years back, Remy blogged about how the origin of the event name changed (and perhaps matured) over the years in a post called [What's In A Name?](https://remysharp.com/2016/07/22/whats-in-a-name)

This week we were drawn to Andy Bell's/Set Studio's [Support Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/support-piccalilli/).

The page title doesn't quite do the page justice, the core tennant being: **This isn’t the internet we want** - this is a value that FFConf also drives towards.

Piccalilli aims to contribute towards the better web through their open and public development process, teaching you along the way - that's a great reason to check the resource out but also share it with the newcomers to the industry.

What's even more important, to us, is trying to find a way that we (that is, all of us) can contribute something positive towards keeping the web open to everyone. The sad alternative is shrugging and accepting that large corporations control everything, jobs can be swapped for AI agents, and junior jobs are headed for the void.

But if all that's a bummer, [here's something we found](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/1kex7mi/people_just_cant_resist_it/) to temporarily cheer us up!
