Important news - our first run of a very limited number of _pre-launch-peekaboo tickets_ - which will be released a week from today, next **Monday 27 June at 10am UK time**.

So what the hell is a "peekaboo ticket" when it's at home? Well, this round of tickets will be available *before* any topics are announced on the web site.

Yes, you'll be buying on trust, but I should hope that the 13ish years we've been running our event we've earned that from you.

That said, since it is limited, there will also be a larger proportion of tickets set aside for the "main" release. This date is still being decided between myself (Rem) and Julie - but expect it to be during July.

Whilst I can't tell you what we have in store for you, I can tell you that [our CFP is open](https://ffconf.org/cfp) and the submissions are rolling in - so please help spread the word if you know someone who should take a chance on us.

The event will be held, as always, at the Duke of Yorks cinema in Brighton and run on **11 November** from 9am to 6pm (with a social event in the evening running until late).

Tickets for the pre-launch-peekaboo batch will be priced at ¬£200+VAT (held at 2019 prices) and tickets during the "main" batch will be ¬£229+VAT.

Other than that, have a great week and we'll be in touch again in 7 days with a link for that early batch.
