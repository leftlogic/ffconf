Continuing with the speaker reveals, let's meet our next two amazing individuals.

As I talked about last week, the curation process for events is extremely important to me, and this year, every single speaker has been individually sought out and asked if they can address a specific topic.

Our next two speakers are Jo Franchetti and Michaela Lehr.

I see ffconf having an important part in sharing knowledge and experience, but then once you go back to your day job, it's your job to pass on that inspiration. **Jo Franchetti** will talk to use about being better mentors, using Jo's own personal experiences from being a self-taught developer and importantly how mentoring is more than just passing on knowledge.

Next I'd like to introduce **Michaela Lehr** who I approached to speak about WebVR and WebAR, better known as WebXR. This may not be applicable to my day-to-day job, but it's important to know what the browser is capable of, and creatively it's brilliant what such a readily available interface can do. Michaela is going to give us a tour of what can be done with today's libraries and today's JavaScript.

One of our sponsors, Mozilla has some really great demos on their WebVR blog: [https://blog.mozvr.com/](https://blog.mozvr.com/)
