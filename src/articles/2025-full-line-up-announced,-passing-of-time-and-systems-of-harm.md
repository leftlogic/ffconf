## Latest Event News

We are delighted to announce our final two speakers, [Surya Rose and Chetan Padia](https://2025.ffconf.org#sessions)

Previous attendees might recognise these two faces. Surya has been coming to FFConf since he was 9 years old and has given talks at Async. Chetan has been kindly leading the early morning run since 2019!

This means we now have a full line up of sessions and we couldn't be more excited about the topics that are being discussed. From human agency to web components, from bias to cults, from AI to learning to code, from the good internet to cookies.

Meet all our speakers on 14th November!

## From Our Archive

As we approach our 15th(!) FFConf, our thoughts turn to time and how our family has changed over the years, how the web has changed since the 00's and so we dug deep into the archive, back to 2013, to [Jeremy Keith](https://ffconf.org/talks/time/) and his talk called TIME.

In his talk, Jeremy reveals he has placed a bet that a [URL](https://longbets.org/601/) will not be still live in 2022. I will leave you to learn whether he won or lost and had to pay out $1000 to charity!

[Amy Hupe](https://ffconf.org/talks/2024_amy/), our 2024 speaker, has launched the second series of her excellent podcast '[Systems of Harm](https://systems-of-harm.fireside.fm)' - go subscribe!

The first episode with [Geri Reid](https://gerireid.com/) discussed what does effective activism look like when it comes to design systems and inclusion? Why are so many of us missing the mark when making the case for prioritising accessibility, and what can we do about it?
