We're pleased to release the last two talks of our FFConf 2024 event.

Let's start with Michael Kibedi's introducing the idea of death and technology. It's a really interesting topic that's not really considered very much in technology - what happens when a product dies and all my "cloud storage" dies with it? [Let Michael explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fKsdVjDF_Y&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=7).

Finally, Imran Afzal's excellent talk on The Art of Reflection. To me, one of the most valuable take aways from Imran's talk was taking the time to be still to reflect (though, it's possibly obvious from the title). I (and probably "we") never really stop, not in work and not in my personal projects. [Imran has some excellent things to say about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y37rDf5gPtI&list=PLXmT1r4krsTo5KtThq4dATD_ctsV8mdJQ&index=8).

And that's it for our talks from 2024. If you want to join us for 2025 then [our newsletter](https://ffconf.org/news/) is the best place to get first dibs on tickets when we launch, otherwise you can find us on [the socials](https://bsky.app/profile/ffconf.org).
