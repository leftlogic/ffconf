Not a day goes past without a discussion about AI. Its omnipresence, its benefits, its environmental impact.

Maggie Appleton asks when language models can churn out millions of human-like words, images, and videos in seconds, what happens to human creation and connection on the web? [Watch Maggie's talk, it's incredible](https://ffconf.org/talks/2023_maggie/)

There's been some useful developments with respect to what "[Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline/)" support means for developers.

This recent [Google IO talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beYbnNT_02U) from Rachel Andrew ([who spoke 9 years ago](https://ffconf.org/talks/next-level-css/)) looks at using baseline feature usage in our tooling such as VS Code and [ESLint](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/baseline-demos/tree/main/tooling/eslint) along with our Netlify instances.

For instance, although our FFConf website(s) use CSS nesting, from the baseline _widely available_ figures and our actual visitors, I can see that most users wonâ€™t support this so itâ€™s a good plan to process the CSS through postcss.

_Please note that although web.dev have sponsored us in the past, this is not a sponsored link - Remy just thought it would be useful to fellow developers._
