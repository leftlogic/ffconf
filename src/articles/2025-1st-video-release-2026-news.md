## 2025 News

What an amazing day FFConf 2025 was - our 9 speakers absolutely smashed it and your feedback on the day was absolutely glowing.

We are delighted to share the first two videos from our 15th FFConf.

[Hellen Ward](https://youtu.be/1MVJ1mjJGQk?si=f6gxbGqEhfX85o9d) opened the day talking about diversity in tech and invited the audience to consider how better representation leads to more effective technology.

Followed by [Chetan Padia](https://youtu.be/j1h5ft77rQ0?si=-wN1KCowgzm2et4S) who deep dived into privacy on a daily basis and gave some actions on detaching yourself from big tech.
