## From Our Archive

As the world around us has changed and we have matured, the curation of FFConf has shifted from a purely tech conference. This is perfectly illustrated by Heydon Pickering's talk on [Capitalism, The Web, and You](https://ffconf.org/talks/2022_heydonworks_talk/)

The talk has been viewed almost 4,000 times, a testament to Heydon who brings humour to a complex subject that affects us all.

## Community News

This week, sadly, [Middlesborough Front End](https://www.middlesbroughfe.co.uk/blog/goodbye) announced after six years they will not be running again. In their words "please keep supporting local events. You don’t know what you have until it’s gone."

Especially if you're in the North of England, then you should grab a last minute ticket to [Front End North](https://frontendnorth.com) and attend a wonderful UK event.

Your community is waiting to meet you.
