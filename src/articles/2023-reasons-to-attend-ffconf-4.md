**Salma Alam-Naylor**: Entertainment as Code

Salma's origin story: _This is what happens when you combine a high school music teacher, a comedian, a front end developer, and the strange novelty of live streaming on the internet._

With a repeating the mantra of "I write code for _your_ entertainment" (where I imagine visitors demand to be entertained!) you can find Salma [over on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/whitep4nth3r/videos) live coding and on [her blog](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/).

**Ana Rodrigues**: Exploring the Potential of the Web Speech API in Karaoke

Ana's origin story: _In the early 2000s, I needed more than my favourite band's official website. So I learned how to code in order to build a proper fan site._

Ana also has an [excellent blog](https://ohhelloana.blog/) - which smacks a lot of _indie web_ - (a good thing), she uses web mentions, her blog is part of a web ring (proper old school) and even has a [guestbook](https://ohhelloana.blog/guestbook/) that you can sign [using webmentions](https://ohhelloana.blog/rsvp-using-webmentions/).
