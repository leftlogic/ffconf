Thank you so much for joining us this year for the 10th FFConf. It was (another) huge success going by all the lovely tweets and [blogs](https://conorhaining.com/A-Trip-To-Brighton-FFConf/) ([and more blogs](https://carolgilabert.me/blog/ffconf-2018) and [notes](https://github.com/AniaMakes/resources-and-notes/blob/master/conference-writeups/ffconf2018.md) and [reviews](https://www.sitepen.com/blog/2018/11/14/reflecting-on-ffconf-2018/)), and excitement and happiness you all exhibited after the event.

Our videographer is in the final throes of editing the videos, then we have the process of uploading, captioning and then releasing over the coming weeks - so look out for those.

I know you all loved the music ðŸŽ¶ to FFConf and the occasional Rick Rollin' so here's our Spotify playlist for your pleasure: [ffconf.org/playlist](https://ffconf.org/playlist)

The photos from the day are [also online](https://twitter.com/seb_ly/status/1064453861249884160) (thanks to Seb's amazing photography), and if you have your own, tag them with #FFConf so we can see them too!

The next FFConf is booked for Friday 8 November 2019, so pop that in your diary and look out for when tickets, student tickets and scholarships go live next year.

Thanks again for all the very excellent memories.
