_Remember: it's the same line up, the same content, the same amazing day._

## Curation all the way

Unlike a lot of other events, FFConf is carefully curated by me, Remy. CFP has typically only accounted for just one of the eight talks in previous years. As soon as the previous FFConf event is over, I start thinking about the _types of talks_ I want to hear.

The process (since 2011) has been to list the topics I want to host at **FFConf**, then match that content up to a potential speaker.

My invitations to speakers are always asking if they would speak to a particular topic or specific question.

As a conference speaker myself, I find it a little frustrating to receive an invitation that simply says "can you speak at our event". Sure, I'd be happy to speak, but _why_ are you inviting me?

Again, as a speaker myself, I felt like a significant number of events would use the same speaker year after year. With that in mind, I made one of **FFConf's** golden rules: no speaker speaks again.

It's a blessing and a curse for curation! It's made curation harder and harder as the years have piled on! The _huge_ positive upshot is that FFConf has hosted 78 unique individuals since 2009 üéâ

Why don't we reveal speakers? Initially this was an accident back in 2014 they were going to be revealed - but I just forgot!

The following year, I realised that hiding (or blurring) the speakers only reinforced the idea that FFConf is content first. We do start to slowly reveal the speakers much closer to the time.

Painstakingly careful curation is absolutely one of the keys to the success of our event. If you're thinking of running an event yourself, I'd highly recommend it. And if you want to see how it works out, see it first hand at [**FFConf in November**](https://ffconf.org/tickets).

## And now for a word from our sponsors ‚ù§Ô∏è

We wouldn't be able to run FFConf with the support of some truly amazing companies. Many of them have positions available at their companies and it would mean a lot to myself and Julie if you took a moment to check out what they're doing and what they have to offer.

They are:

*   [Beamly](https://www.beamly.com/#section-join-us)
*   TheFinancial Times - [junior and senior developers wanted](https://github.com/Financial-Times/careers)
*   [American Express](https://jobs.americanexpress.com/technology)
*   Google - [their amazing developer learning centre](https://developers.google.com/web/)
*   [Mozilla](http://mozilla.com/)

## Signing off for now

Our newsletter has been quiet during the summer holidays, but we'll be back with more insights, including how we run our diversity scholarship programme, how the FFConf web site runs and some of the fun we had with accidental DDoS on our ticket provider and more.

And if you ever have any questions about FFConf or how we run the event, don't hesitate to hit reply and myself or Julie will be more than happy to answer.

Until next time,

‚Äì Remy (& Julie) üëã
