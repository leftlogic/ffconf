It's nearly a week since FFConf 2024 finished and wow, what a day. The speakers were amazing and brought exactly the kind of content our event promises year on year from start to finish.

There's also a free ticket for FFConf 2025 (yes, we're running again, 14 November 2025) available. All that's required to be entered in a draw is to send us your thoughts/write up/blog post/etc of the event. Either reply to events@leftlogic.com with the link or ping us on [socials](https://bsky.app/profile/ffconf.org).

We'll announce the winner on December 2nd (and email directly).

Finally, [photos by Trys Mudford](https://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/albums/72177720321895884) are online and videos will be uploaded (to YouTube with captions) as they're edited in the coming weeks, so we'll let you know when those are live too.

Thanks again,

â€“ Remy & Julie
