## Latest Event News

Meet our speakers! We are welcoming Hannah Clarke to FFConf to talk about "An Uncomfortable Place"

**What’s your origin story?**

> Spent my teenage years learning HTML and CSS for my MySpace profile (my falling stars were next level). Never considered web development when I went to study politics, then glaciology (obviously…), followed by a career running social inclusion projects. But these days I'm a UI Engineer. Full circle.

**If your MySpace profile was still live today, what song would auto-play when someone visited?**

> If I was still keeping it updated then the new Deftones track for sure. If it was the same page left unaltered from when I was 16 then probably something like Bright Eyes - Lover I Don't Have to Love </3 (or something shamefully emo...)

**What’s the biggest misconception developers have about web components today?**

> That they're somehow inferior to framework built components. Or won't work in their specific framework eco-system.

You can read Hannah's [full interview questions and responses](/articles/2025-meet-the-speaker-hannah/) in our latest articles.

Meet Hannah and our other speakers on 14th November.

## From Our Archive

We know that there is something special about FFConf. We can't put it into words so we want to share the words of people who have sat in the audience and on stage:

Tereza K sums up their experience of FFConf in [2023](https://dev.to/terezak/ffconf-2023-3jh0):

> As a shy, low-energy introvert who can struggle in social situations, I am always surprised at how much I enjoy the post-conference social. I interpret this as a sign of how friendly and inclusive the FFConf community is.
>
> You get a chance to chat with brilliant, kind and funny people. Even if, like me, you feel out of place and are terrified at first. Chances are there are others, so you can find them, or someone will introduce themselves or include you in a conversation.

And one of our speakers that year, [Ana Rodrigues](https://ohhelloana.blog/ffconf-2023/) wrote about her experience on stage. Ana describes FFConf as a "[life-changing conference](https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana/111171359089249081):

> Not only did I find my current job through chatting with people there, but the talks I saw and the people I met throughout the years were the inspiration and acceptance I desperately needed to find.

Some homework set by our 2025 speaker, Hannah Clarke if you want to become familiar with web components in advance of her talk:

> Check out the [Daily Developer Tips](https://gomakethings.com/articles/) from Chris Ferdinandi - they're usually web component related and you can sign up to get them in your inbox every day. I've learnt some really cool stuff through his articles.
