We are pleased to share that FFConf will be back on **Friday 14th November 2025!**

ðŸ—£ We have opened our [call for papers](https://ffconf.org/cfp) - the link includes the topics that are piquing Remy's interest and also our promise to all speakers.

ðŸŽ© As always, we need your company's support to run our event and budget for things like our scholarship. Please [email us to request a sponsor pack](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=Request%20sponsorship%20pack)

ðŸŽŸ Our next email will be about **early access tickets**, so watch out for that, and if you're reading this post on [our site](https://ffconf.org) - make sure to sign up for [the newsletter](https://ffconf.org/news).

Please help us spread the word, and make sure to tell the boss that you're coming to the UK's best web developer conference held in Brighton, in the Duke of Yorks, in November!

Finally, if there is a speaker who you think should be on the FFConf stage, drop us a message, either [email](mailto:events@leftlogic.com) or on our [discord](https://ffconf.org/chat), we'd love to hear from you.
