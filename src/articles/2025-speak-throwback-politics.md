## Latest Event News

For 8 months of every year, FFConf consumes The Sharp Household and our thoughts turn to our wonderful FFConf Community.

We're doing something different with our newsletter. You'll receive a weekly email with three easy to digest sections: news about the 2025 event, delving into the FFConf archive, and sharing a link that's relevant to our community.

We opened our [call for papers](https://ffconf.org/cfp) last week and if you are considering applying, Lex Lofthouse wrote this really great [insight](https://loftio.co.uk/ffconf2022/) into her experience with us in 2022.

## From Our Archive

Did you know our [archive site](https://ffconf.org/talks/) contains nearly 100 videos which have been viewed over 250,000 times?

It includes Simon Willison's audio from his talk that he changed the subject at the very last minute, even working through the night right before the event.

He had learned about an exciting new technology called "[Node](https://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/)" and wanted to be the first to share it in the UK at FFConf in 2009 - **our very first event!**

## Community News

For those who have been part of the FF Family for a while, you will have noticed the change to the curation and topics on stage to reflect the world around us changes.
