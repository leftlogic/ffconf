## Latest Event News

FFConf has a reputation for being friendly and welcoming but we still appreciate that coming to a conference where you might not know anyone, or you haven't been for a while, can be a daunting prospect.

We want to share that beyond the inspiring and informative talks, how you can experience FFConf's welcoming atmosphere:

🎤 [Show and Tell with Async](https://asyncjs.com/international-show-n-tell-2025/). Our friends at Async run a very special International Show & Tell the night before FFConf. They welcome you to give a 5 minute talk or just attend and meet fellow delegates on a smaller scale.

🏃 **Fancy an early morning run?** A casual 5K run led by friendly FFConf locals for all levels of fitness before the conference opens. See Brighton before the city really wakes up and hope for some sunshine!

☕️ **For those who prefer a slower start to the day**, our friends at [Brighton Codebar](https://codebar.io/brighton) host a coffee morning to welcome delegates for early refreshments.

🍲 **Lunch with Future Friends!** Remy has experienced that moment at a conference when everyone piles out of the venue in groups and he has been left eating a sandwich alone. We never want this to happen to you so we reserve a large area in two nearby pubs so just turn up and break bread.

🕺🍸 **Social with your attendees**. You can’t visit Brighton without seeing the beach (even if it is November!). We will continue the conversations, food, drinks and games with your new friends at the social.

Join us on 14th November for learning, connection and ice cream. Plus remember, remember the **5th of November** for your last day to nab a standard price ticket at £249+VAT.

Lets escape the gloom and doom with the hilarious Joe Hart with the talk [Alpha, Beta, Gamer: Dev Mode](https://ffconf.org/talks/alpha-beta-gamer-dev-mode/). Joe braves the challenges of coding in front of a live audience whilst allowing hundreds of people to play Flappy Bird together - which ends with the timeless line: _To our villain, the giant dickbutt_!

Joe has also attended FFConf a number of times in the past and wrote up [his own experience](https://www.joehart.co.uk/blogs/thoughts-from-ffconf-13-11-2023/) (a useful read if you're still considering your ticket).
