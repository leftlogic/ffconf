In just 24 hours, we will be opening the doors to the historic Duke of York's for our 15th FFConf.

Meet our last speakers, Jessica Rose and Eda Eren in their wonderfully detailed [interviews](https://ffconf.org/articles/2025-meet-the-speakers-jess-eda/). We are very much looking forward to their talk "Forgetting Machines: AI Coding Tools and Skill".

Join us tomorrow for kinship, originality and coffee.
