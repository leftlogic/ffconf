> We all know that Ada Lovelace is credited as the first computer programmer. But what did she write? What did it do? And how does it work?

Then we had Jonathan Fielding on [_**Embracing Neurodiversity in Tech: Building Empathy, Unveiling Strengths**_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iQM0Uw4rms&list=PLZy5V2JKDfX9zq8QeayxXU_Kv__UIV-EP&index=6&pp=gAQBiAQB) who says:

> Unveil the power of neurodiversity. Through personal experiences and practical strategies, foster empathy, challenge stereotypes, and create an inclusive environment for hidden disabilities. Celebrate unique strengths together.

We'll be back this Thursday with the final set of talks from the day.
