It's been (technically) three years we've missed your lovely faces but we are absolutely back, in person, for ffconf 2022. Yay!

Here's some important items you'll want to know (and hopefully you'll help us spread the word):

ðŸ“… The conference will be one day, again, at the Duke of Yorks in Brighton on **Friday 11th November** (and yes, the geek in me loves the binary `1111` version of the date ðŸ¤“)

ðŸ—£ We have opened our [call for papers](https://ffconf.org/cfp) - the link includes all the details of things Remy would love to hear about, but also our promise to all our speakers.

ðŸŽ“ We will, again, have a [scholarship programme](https://ffconf.org/scholarship/) - full details in the link.

ðŸŽ© As always, we need your company's support to run our event and budget for things like our scholarship. Please [email us to request a sponsor pack](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=Request%20sponsorship%20pack)

ðŸŽŸ Our next email will be about tickets, so watch out for that, and if you're reading this post on [our site](https://ffconf.org) - make sure to sign up for [the newsletter](https://ffconf.org/news).

That's all folks. We miss you. We'll see you again. Please help us spread the word, and make sure to tell the boss that you're coming to the UK's best and only web developer conference in Brighton, in the Duke of Yorks in November!
