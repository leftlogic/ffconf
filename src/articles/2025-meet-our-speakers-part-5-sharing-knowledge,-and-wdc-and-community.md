Meet our speakers! We are welcoming Asim Hussain to FFConf letting us know how we "[Don't Be An Idiot](https://2025.ffconf.org/asim)"

Asim's talk is optimistic but realistic - about human agency rather than human obsolescence. It's not another "AI will save/destroy us all" talk.

**You're blending AI, ancient democracy, and open source - was there a thread that helped you tie these seemingly distant ideas together?**

>There are two forces, a force that concentrates power (which is not always bad) and a force which dilutes power (which is not always good). It's the dance between those forces that creates life. Democracy, Open Source and even AI are tools of the dancers.

**You've said this isnâ€™t another 'AI will save or doom us all' kind of talk. What sort of conversations do you wish we were having instead?**

>How do we change the world so it's better for everyone and everything?

Read Asim's [full interview](https://ffconf.org/articles/2025-meet-the-speaker-asim/) and meet Asim and all our speakers on 14th November!

FFConf is not just another tech conference where you learn the shiniest new tools. What really matters to us how we can become better humans; on the web and in our communities.

Which is why we welcomed Jo Franchetti and her talk called [Mentoring: Being the help you wish you'd had](https://ffconf.org/talks/mentoring/) back in 2018 which talks precisely to this ethos.

Jo explains that mentoring can cement your own knowledge, improve your communication skills, develop your cognitive diversity and increase your confidence. Jo highlights some organisations where you can find mentors/mentees so check them out.

## Community News

Last week, Remy gave a lightning talk (on fixing Gameboys!) and attended WDC in Bristol (a conference we highlighted here a few weeks ago). Our 2024 Alumni speaker, [Michael Kibedi](https://uxmichaelco.substack.com/) has shared his [experience of the day](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7383452703462535168/).

Community run conferences are the [lifeblood of the web](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-lifeblood-of-the-web):

>They are like a cheat code, like a magic door â€“ you enter, and suddenly, you find yourself on the inside of the conversation. The faces, the names, the people behind the blog posts â€“ they become real. And you stop feeling like just being an observer of the Web community. You are now a part of it.

Keep supporting your favourite conference/meet up/event wherever you find them.
