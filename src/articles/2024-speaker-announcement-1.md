Announcing soon: _A talk on AI and accessibility - what's the reality?_

## üíû Support and sponsor ffconf

We have some fantastic sponsorship opportunities available with significant visibility during the event. One example is our famous ice-cream sponsorship, which includes featuring your branding on our ice-cream cartons and exposure through photos and direct engagement with attendees.

We also have our inclusion sponsorship positions, allowing your company to support our scholarship program, which **reserves 10% of the event attendance for marginalised groups** by providing tickets, travel, and accommodation - a meaningful cause to be associated with.
