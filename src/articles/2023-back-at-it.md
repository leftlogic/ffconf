We hope you're doing well and staying safe as you settle into 2023. We're announcing the next ffconf will be held on **Friday 10th November 2023**. We'll also be in touch with ticket launch dates (approximately in June).

If you missed the talks from last year, you can catch up on them all on our [ffconf archive site](https://ffconf.org/talks/?filter=&years=2022). We had really incredible talks last year, and we'd highly recommend checking them out.

But we can't do it again alone! We rely on the support of sponsors to make this event happen. So, if you or your company are interested in supporting our event, please don't hesitate to email us at [events@leftlogic.com](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=sponsorship). We have a range of packages available, and we would be happy to discuss how we can best meet your needs.

Oh, and one last thing! We wanted to let you know that codebar Festival is running 6th-11th March. A five day event with workshops, talks and panels covering all things tech, career and wellbeing. Check it out and share [festival.codebar.io](https://festival.codebar.io)
