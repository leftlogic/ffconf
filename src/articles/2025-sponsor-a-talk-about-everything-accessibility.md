Last week, we highlighted Natalia's talk who references Lena Reinhard's _[Talk About Everything](https://ffconf.org/talks/a-talk-about-everything/)_ from 2015. Natalia describes it as:

> to date, the most powerful and inspiring presentation that I have ever seen and â€¦ the reason why I have become the developer I am.

Lena's message of privilege, responsibility and power sadly still resonate. Almost 10 years on, we are still having the same conversations about discrimination, harassment, safe spaces, diversity.

We need to build technology for everyone because "our technology is political; with every design, with every line of code, with every action, we need to take a stand because everything matters".

Take some time and [watch Lena's](https://ffconf.org/talks/a-talk-about-everything/) talk.

## Community News

Our friends at Tetralogical have created [Accessibility Unlocked](https://tetralogical.com/newsletters/accessibility-unlocked/) a free six-day email series for anyone, at any stage of their accessibility journey - which hopefully is all of you!

The series offers practical guidance, useful resources, and a customisable roadmap to help you design, build, and manage more accessible digital experiences.

Whilst Tetralogical have sponsored in the past, this is not a paid post, just something we think is useful to our community.
