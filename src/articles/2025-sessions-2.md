Right on schedule, and then promptly the day after I was supposed to schedule the release (ü§¶) here is Andy Bell and Kimberley Blessing's talks from the day.

Andy Bell spoke around the topic of communication. It's far from rocket science but Andy does a brilliant job (whilst being entertaining) of comparing and contrasting terrible and lazy exchange with subtly tweaked and much more effective exchange.

Then to close the first half of our day last year, Kimberley Cook, director and trustee of Codebar, talked about the experience of building a community and the mistakes and learnings she experienced along to way to Codebar becoming 27,000 strong community.

That's it for this week. Next Monday (or‚Ä¶ Tuesday): Amy Hupe on meaning and Mike Hall on critical thinking.
