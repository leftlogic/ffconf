The first of our talks from FFConf 2019 have been published, perfect weekend viewing to chew down some great discussion and ideas to start on our journey to being better web citizens.

First is Sharon Steed's [***Engaging Empathy***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW7H0swnxyU&list=PLXmT1r4krsTrR6khetJSVQqulyFbxmZNG&index=2), which describes their talk with:

> Empathy and vulnerability aren't necessarily two words associated with professional success, but they're invaluable to achieving long-term goals leaders set for their companies. Lets both define what those look like at work and how to engage them for optimized collaboration.

Next was Amina Adewusi on [***What does it take to become a developer in 2020?***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvgGcXuvLPs&list=PLXmT1r4krsTrR6khetJSVQqulyFbxmZNG&index=3) a personal story as described:

> Amina shares her story about what it takes to become a developer after teaching herself how to code, juggling a full-time job and baby.

Both these talks we excellent and well received and indeed exactly what I (Remy) wanted and _needed_ to start my own 2020 on the right foot.
