Everyone knows FFConf started in 2009 but did you know that it started in the pub on a snowy day in Brighton? It took only nine months from a random conversation over a beer to [become the conference we all know and love](/articles/2025-the-origin-story-of-ffconf-by-julie/).

> Remy was complaining about the lack of a conference in the UK that talked about things he was interested in (JavaScript and the web) and that he wanted to attend. So I grabbed a (paper) pub menu and together we sketched out the idea – venue, speakers, possible dates, budget, sponsorship, marketing, website. We still have that piece of paper.

The web development (and tech industry) as a whole, as you know, is awash with articles _about_ AI. So it's hard not to point to lots of articles (though do let us know if you'd like that too).

With that in mind, we'd highly recommend this excellent long form interview with [Karen Hao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8enXRDlWguU&list=PL9f7WaXxDSUrEWXNZ_wO8tML0KjIL8d56&index=3) author of [Empire of AI](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/460331/empire-of-ai-by-hao-karen/9780241678923) that covers how AI is often misunderstood, debunks myths, and shows the industry’s full scope — from CEOs to exploited workers. Watch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8enXRDlWguU&list=PL9f7WaXxDSUrEWXNZ_wO8tML0KjIL8d56&index=3).
