**Steven Goodwin**: Ada Lovelace and The Very First Computer Program

Steven's origin story: _I have been involved in computing, science, and technology since the family computer, a Sinclair ZX81, moved in with me to become my first piece of domesticated hardware._

Who doesn't love a bit of computing history!? On that, Steven has also been writing [a book](https://unbound.com/books/20goto10/) that Remy had backed in 2021.

**Angela Ricci**: We need to talk about the front web

Angela's origin story: _I fell into a cauldron of a magic potion called the web, when it was still cooking. Since then, web technologies became my super power for designing new interfaces._

Remy had the pleasure of working with [Angela in 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20130928053703/http://line-mode.cern.ch/interviews#:~:text=my%20time%20to.%22-,Angela%20Ricci,-Name%3A) and in [2019](https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/production/) both times at CERN to recreate some of the first web browsers in the world.

***üíû Support and sponsor FFConf***

‚úâÔ∏è [Get in touch to join our event today](mailto:events@leftlogic.com?subject=Request%20for%20sponsor%20pack%20%5B2023%5D)

We have some fantastic sponsorship opportunities available with significant visibility during the event. Example options are our ice-cream sponsorship, which includes featuring your branding on our ice-cream cartons and exposure through photos and direct engagement with attendees.

We also have our inclusion sponsorship slot, allowing your company to support our scholarship program, which reserves 10% of event spaces for marginalised groups by providing tickets, travel, and accommodation - a meaningful cause to be associated with.
