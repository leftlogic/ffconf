    "description": "JavaScript had a bumpy ride up to now, from its origins as a CGI-replacement, initiator of countless popups and annoying effects over the renaissance as Ajax enabler up to becoming wrapped up in libraries to work around the hell that is browser differences.\n\n\n\nWith the ubiquity of JavaScript comes a new challenge. How do we keep JavaScript safe when browsers don't really distinguish between different sources and give them all the same rights? Why do we still judge the usefulness of JavaScript by how badly browsers speak it?\n\n\n\nLearn about some environments you can use JavaScript in securely and marvel at the magic and annoyances that are technologies that try to put a lock on the issue of JavaScript security.",

    "description": "We know the future of the web is mobile, but what's the future of mobile? In this session, you'll learn how to step-up mobile app development with widgets and device APIs. Add these two technologies to your toolbox to begin building next-gen mobile apps today.\n\n\n\nWith more than 4.6 billion handsets on the planet, we know the future of the web is mobile, but what's the future of mobile? The latest builds of mobile browsers include HTML5 APIs, which enable speedy hardware-accelerated CSS, offline capability, client-side storage, geolocation and other goodies. But, what's next?\n\n\n\nTwo web technologies are ushering in the next generation of mobile apps: widgets and device APIs. As self-contained web apps, widgets significantly improve user experience. Device APIs do more than extend web apps to mobile devices. They allow access to native device sensors, like the accelerometer and camera, and to data such as photos and contacts. By adding widgets and device APIs to your toolbox, you can start building sophisticated mobile apps now.\n\n\n\nIn this session, PhoneGap hacker Brian LeRoux will guide you through the step-by-step creation of a W3C widget. He'll show you how to combine it with device APIs and deploy it using the PhoneGap open source framework. Learn how to develop for the mobile web of the future, today.",

But now we've grown up, and we have WebGL, Canvas, Web Audio, Media Capture and more. To really exploit this power, we have to step outside the comfort zone of text-oriented publishing and engage with the full field of computer engineering.\n\n\n\nMaths are an essential part of this. While for most people, maths inspires dread, it's the most powerful tool we have, and the most flexible lego set you can get your hands on. In this talk I want to show you some clever mathematical machines, and what the pieces inside are doing. In a browser, naturally. And while true mathematicians will frown at the clear disregard for rigorous derivation, I think my way is more fun.\n\n\n\n",

Widely used application frameworks like SenchaTouch and SproutCore effectively bypass HTML altogether, going straight from JavaScript to the DOM.\n\n\n\nSo is the era of HTML over? Or does it still have a place building web applications, as well as web pages?\n\n\n\nJohn Allsopp believes so, and in this presentation will consider in very practical terms why eschewing HTML in web application development may not be a great leap forward at all.\n\n\n\n",

I'll explain why they are all excellent and rubbish at the same time, why you need to use all of them, and walk through the techniques to consider when building a web application that can load and function with no network connectivity. But making use of client side storage is not just necessary to make an app that works offline - it can also hugely improve the user experience of your site when the user does have connectivity as well. The examples will feature real-life code from our FT and the Economist applications, so you know that the techniques here are applicable to large, complex problems and not just contrived examples.\n\n\n\n",
